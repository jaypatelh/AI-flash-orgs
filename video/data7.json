Now the main focus will be on herbs3 A viewer sees 10 different herbs as they rotate slowly around the center, the center is a tea bag. Herbs should be in 3D as well and as close to real image as possible4  A viewer sees how herb # 1 stops on 12 o clock mark, right above of the tea bag. We use the same effect as we used with a tea bag before, and the camera zooms in and changes an angle sand the herb now is located at the left side of the screen. On the right side of the screen we show short description and beneficial data about the herb.  We explain why each herb is so beneficial and what is the herb - detailed description, VERY IMPORTANT5 Then the camera zooms back and next herb moves t o12 o`clock position, and again the camera zooms in and changes the angle and we see just this particular herb and short description about it, when the description is over, the camera zooms back to the full view of 10 herbs. We repeat this with all herbs that compound a tea bag.6 Once we showed all the herbs, we put them back into the tea bag, next the camera changes the angle and we see how the tea bag goes into the cup of tea. Then, we show how the water inside is transformed into a Miracle Elixir - VERY Important7 Next episode shows how a regular dressed person drinks our tea8 But as soon as a person drank the tea we see how different object begin to appear on his body. We see that this person gets a shield, and a futuristic weapon / blaster, and a futuristic helmet and other futuristic guns and ammunitions. This episode shows Protective functions of herbs, and how they change you from a regular person, how you get supper strength, we show the graph, like a fuel tank from empty to Full how you are loaded with testosterone, and we see how a scale of inflammations drops from Red Zone to green Zone, as we reduce inflammations inside of your body.
