We want someone who has skill in sketchup and 3D design and can create a beautiful stylish home using our ideas. We don't need a floor plan just the exterior design to submit to contractors and the county . I can supply as many photos of the home as needed and give example ideas we would like incorporated into the remodel. We are looking for a more traditional craftsman style home nothing to modern. The house is currently a 45x30 plain jane box with a low 4/12 pitch roof built on a full walkout basement. we are not against changing the roof line if need be but also would like to see if anyone has ideas to incorporate our additions into the roof line as is and still give the home new character but if that is not possible then we would welcome ideas with a new steeper roof pitch. The editions are as follows, a new entry foyer and extended living room on one end of the house and a 16 foot extension to the other end and an attached 2 car garage. We have ideas and drawing of our own but are open to other ideas as well. I have revised this posting twice today to be more precise as to what we are looking for. We really want someone passionate about residential home design and someone who can help us envision our home as we would like to see it. our ultimate goal is to have a workable usable drawing to submit to contractors for bid yet this winter so we can begin work in the spring. The reason I requested sketchup experience is because I have that program on my computer and would like to import the finished design onto my laptop to play with the color schemes, roofing and siding options and roofing materials to see what looks best if that is possible.", "title": "Do some 3D Modelling"}, {"url": "/projects/video-services/create-video-15622004/", "desc": "Videography and photography at wedding and reception", "title": "Create a Video"}, {"url": "/projects/video-services/design-project-15622353/", "desc": "I need a 3D model of something.", "title": "Design project"}, {"url": "/projects/video-services/hire-video-editing-professional-15622314/", "desc": "Solicito un video institucional de resumen de evento a partir de diferentes videos de un evento.
