There are some requirements for it though,Userfriendly:I have by no means any coding experience and would like to see an proper GUI to set settings for the bot. Having it work with a firefox browser would be very nice.Multiple instances:The bot must be able to play unlimited individual accounts simultaneous with the option to add more in the futureAutomatic Account creation:The bot must be able to make the accounts themselves and remember it logins for ad supported streaming services. If a user is forgotten (or blocked for that matter) it is removed from the bot system and a new one is created,. It must be able to play all accounts I input that are subscription based.Undectable:At least put every safety measure in to avoid detection.Automatic streaming /w intervals:The ability to adjust metrics like duration, interval, skip through rate (after x songs) to mimic human behaviour. In addition the bot will change every 12 hours their metrics slightly (with 1 to 2%) but between human-like thresholds. I would also like it to have a play counter for each instance as well.Templates:The ability to export and import templates from this bot. Just so settings are quickly up and running. This includes links to playlists.Places to stream:-Youtube- Spotify-Soundcloud- Deezer- Apple Music (I am aware its subcription based, this will be for accounts I own)- Tidal (I am aware its subcription based, this will be for accounts I own)- Google Play (I am aware its subcription based, this will be for accounts I own)- Groove (I am aware its subcription based, this will be for accounts I own)- Amazon Music (I am aware its subcription based, this will be for accounts I own)- Napster (I am aware its subcription based, this will be for accounts I own)Price:We can talk about it, I understand if it would somewhere in the range of $300 to $500. I do have one condition before I pay. I pay 50% up front and want to have a quarter test period to check and verify that it works. I have never done this before and would like to see if my music distributor registers the revenue. If so, you get the other 50% paid.If interested please send me a message.", "title": "Build music/video streaming bot"}, {"url": "/projects/photography/help-write-something-15233894/", "desc": "I need you to write a report for something.", "title": "Help me write something"}, {"url": "/projects/video-services/recipedesign-project/", "desc": "I need a 3D model of something.
