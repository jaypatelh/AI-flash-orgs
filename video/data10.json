They will be shown one next to the other. Each one will have different properties, like: Mana (number), Power (number), Life (number) and a property = (text). This should be shown as a general character, maybe abstract.....2) User life character - This character will represent the life for the user. It will be placed on the game grid at the start of the game. Need to be unique!3-6) Those are the 4 grid characters that will move/attack the other enemy characters . They should be epic characters, different from each other.More:- 4 symbols that will represent 4 Weapons/Powers of the 4 grid characters.-Each character should be design in 2 colors, for each player.-All characters (except for the Hand character) will need animations (sprite sheets) for: Stand, Walk, Attack, Die and use property states.-Sound: Each character will need a sound for each state (place on hand, place on grid, walk, attack, die, use property.-Sound: Game sound affects: start turn, end turn, clicks, win, lose.This is my first project I'm building alone and I'm pretty done with the game logic.

I am a home buyer and i purchase directly from home owner.There are many benefits of selling directly to me rather then a real estate agent and or putting it on the real estate market and i will share them below. If you can animate all this with a female voice over explaining some of the benefits of using a direct cash buyer like me rather than turning to a real estate agency. I will list more information below which you may use to reference.Also here are some video just so you have an idea of what i am asking for. Like i said a voice over with a lady is important if it is difficult to include you may do it without, but this can give you an idea of how it should look.

While you may be able to get a higher \u201ctop line\u201d sales price listing with a local Jersey City, Hudson County, New Jersey agent, that doesn\u2019t always boil down to more money in your pocket or less headache. Dive into the details below to compare your options.Work The Numbers And See Which Way Helps You Get There\u2026When you really work the numbers you start to see the real benefits that each way of selling your house offers.Yes, here at Allan Buys Homes we won\u2019t be able to offer you full retail value for your house\u2026 but we also offer other benefits that going the traditional house sale route can\u2019t offer.Like\u2026From offer to close and cash in your hand in as little as 7 daysYou can get rid of the headache of that property fast and avoid paying any more utility payments, tax payments, insurance payments, mortgage payments, you get the drill. If you list your house and wait 90+ days to close\u2026 you have to figure in all of the costs of holding that property during the time you have that property listed and are waiting for the property to close.Don\u2019t worry about paying those pesky closing fees (we\u2019ve got you covered)Because we are a full-service professional home buyer here in , we make it easy for you. We pay for all of the closing costs. What we offer you is what you get (of course minus any mortgage payoff or other encumbrances on the property). Pretty refreshing eh?So when you add up the time you could save by working with Allan Buys Homes , the no-hassle experience, and the money you\u2019ll save on commissions, fees, and holding costs while you wait to sell the traditional route\u2026 for many area home owners selling to a professional house buyer is the best viable option.", "title": "Animation for Real Estate"}, {"url": "/projects/video-services/design-project-15613129/", "desc": "I need a 3D model of something.", "title": "Design project"}, {"url": "/projects/video-editing/make-video-15613118/", "desc": "Living an Experience.. transmute the energy to audience.", "title": "Make a Video"}, {"url": "/projects/video-services/video-creator-15613027/", "desc": "I would like to make a video like this.[url removed, login to view]", "title": "3D video creator"}, {"url": "/projects/video-services/animacion-rotulos-after-effects-segundos/", "desc": "Make animation for text and logo, and page 4 of the PDF file,  arround 5 seconds by animation", "title": "Animacion de rotulos en after effects - de 5 segundos"}, {"url": "/projects/video-editing/make-video-15612966/", "desc": "we \"Quirksta Club\" start up Event Management Company in Coimbatore, We are looking for a  Corporate Video for our Company.", "title": "Make a Video"}, {"url": "/projects/rendering/courtyard-render/", "desc": "I need two renders for a courtyard and a pergola that will be constructed in the courtyard.
