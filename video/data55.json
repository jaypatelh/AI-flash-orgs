My budget will be towards the bottom of the price range i have set for this project and if it's not enough for the video I fully understand. I know animation is a very skilled and time consuming process. Which is why I am not sure if i'll be able to afford it or not. But if the prices are within my range then I would love to hire someone to make a video for my group next month. It will be a 3 minute video approximately, I will provide the music and lyrics to the song  which we have recorded and the video would need to match what is happening in the lyrics. I look forward to hearing from you.

[url removed, login to view] - I like the story telling style of this and the way is flows with the transitions - the seamless transitions, also the animation is smooth to move some elements in 9/10 sec and also around sec 44, another thing is that there is a lot of variation going on, so sometimes you see particles, very nicely designed elements. The mix of glows + 2d elements is nice to have as well2. [url removed, login to view] - Again the way this flows and animates is nice3.
