So for Jason you should animate his face, and make him kind of fainted so it gives the effect that he is appearing out of no where. So recap: Background should be melon color in the middle of the picture should be our logo with a scared face and like a baseball bat in his hand, behind him should be an animated version of Jason's face which I have provided an image. And Jason's face should be faint. The whole point of this game is that you are running away from a guy name Jason. I hope this makes sense if you follow my instructions we should not have a problem.The image I provided the first one is of Jason, and the second one is an example of like Jason's face faded that is kind of how I want it, but do not copy it pleaseBTW in the image with out logo do not worry about the hyena! good luck I am planning to do long term business.Look at this channel I want thumbnails exactly like his.[url removed, login to view]My channel is[url removed, login to view]If you can do what is described above with the images I have provided.
