I am very flexible and extremely down-to-earth with my outsourcing style.- job requirements:-           \u2022.  You need a pc. Know how to edit videos (after effects etc... pretty basic stuff)- I don\u2019t want professional video creation/editing. Simple amateur video creation (few min each video) and a quick modification of a part (sometimes more) of the video. Easy and quick :)- I\u2019m looking for one individual.- You must be capable of following instructions, and keeping track of tasks performed.- I will require a message at the end of a work-time letting me know what was worked on.- Why you want to work for me:- I\u2019m trained in a hands-off management style. I\u2019ll give you a list of things to do, and I\u2019ll let you go do them. I\u2019m not going to be stalking you ten times a day asking for updates and why things aren\u2019t being done. Everything you will need to know will be in the daily/weekly breakdown, and I will always be available for questions.- I\u2019m not going to ask you to video call or team view me or any of that.- I hate micromanaging, so I\u2019m not going to do that with you.- As long as you get done what I ask you to do, I don\u2019t care how little time it takes you, I\u2019m still paying you the $.

I won\u2019t expect to hear from you on Republic Day, Independence Day, Gandhi\u2019s Birthday, Christmas, New Year\u2019s, Maha Shivaratri, Holi, Nag Panchami, Dussehra, Diwali, and whatever else I might be missing. Same goes for other cultures and religions and whatnot.- If I end up firing you, you will have plenty of advance notice. Doing shitty? I\u2019ll mention it. Still doing shitty? That\u2019s a NO-GO. Respect me and expect the same and return.- And here is why you REALLY want to work for me:- Bonuses. I plan to do this with my   assistants.-  Example: Expect a Christmas gift in the form of a cash bonus. Birthday too.

Some 10-15$, cause they will need a bit more work than the 5$ ones.Personally I take 30m to make/edit the videos. I\u2019m not a pro at all! Productivity is key!Initially you may spend a bit more time per video, but when you practice it few times it will become automatic.
