The film takes place primarily on an alien planet that has a lot of sci-fi architecture mixed with natural elements. I'm looking to get about 10 animated shots and 5 still images. These will consist of a detailed 3D alien landscape with a fantasy-like feel. There is a section where I would need a crowd of people and moving elements like birds e.t.c mixed in, it isn't a requirement but a nice bonus if you are able to include these as well. I'm looking for someone who has experience in programs like e-on Vue. If you create great landscapes in other programs, that is okay too. I don't have a preference on the tool you use. I'm also not looking for ultra realism. This isn't Pixar. I'm one person trying to make a feature 3D animation, it can be a little rudimentary, but not completely cartoony. A lot of the shots I need will be following a tram on a monorail throughout the landscape with some caves, waterfalls, arches, rivers, buildings, castles, towers, e.t.cDepending on what program you use, I may be able to do the animation and renderings myself if provided the project files.
