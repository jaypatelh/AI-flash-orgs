The Render Settings are: Physical Renderer, Global Illumination (Light Mapping for Secondary Method), Ambient Occlusion, No Default Lights under Options, Cubic (Still Image), and TIFF Sequence at 1920x1080 Resolution. The Remodeling will cover minor details, but the UV map and Textures need to be adjusted to compensate for the changed geometry. Preferably the 3D modeling should be done in Cinema 4d, but the Rigging, Weight Painting, Texture Adjustments/UV Mapping, and Final Delivery would preferably be done in Cinema 4D R19. The Dragon itself needs to look very realistic, so the Skin Textures need to appear as bumpy, rough, reflective, and organically colorful as a Reptile and Dinosaur's Skin and not plastic (more detail the better). The areas that need to be remodeled are the Face so it appears unique and unrecognizable to other well known dragons (more impressive, prideful and intimidating than terrifying with large teeth), The Top Section of the Dragon In front of the Wings need to be clear of any horns and unnecessary geometry. The Dragon Type and Detail Level is provided in the Uploaded Images, however, the skin needs to look less plastic and more like organic leather. The Rig especially needs to be created in C4D to setup a IK character rig and be weight painted correctly. Create a Rig with IK Controllers for the Legs, Wings, Tail (IK Spline) and Head for the long neck. Head and neck needs to easily stretch out Vertically, Horizontally, and in an \"S\" pose, so if an IK spline isn't plausible then use FK. The Wings are like a bats (illustrated in Uploaded Bat Image). The sheets of skin between the Wings' Arms and Fingers need to fold and wrinkle in a realistic way, so the wings are able to fold away from the body in a realistic looking way. The Eyes should have separate controllers than a single one, and Pose Morph the Head to include several different facial expressions, including shooting fire from its mouth.
