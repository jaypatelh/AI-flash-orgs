We would like this video footage to be blended together to create a sentimental movie so that we will always remember this sad but special day.The video footage we will provide you will have some areas where not much is happening and can be cut from the final video (for example when the video camera has been stuck on record and is filming the ground). We require a Freelancer to understand the importance of this project and ensure that the final movie captures the essence of the special day and each of the special moments.This particular funeral was not a traditional type of funeral. You will notice from the video footage that the funeral is set in a 'burn-out' setting....This is because the deceased man loved loud vehicles, loved burning rubber on his tyres, loved repairing engines, loved riding motor cycles, loved drinking lots of beer, loved listening to loud rock music and having a good time with friends. His wife tried to give him a funeral that was true to the type of person he was. We would like this movie to be styled in a way that suits his personality.This movie will be given to the wife of the man who died, so please ensure you include as much useful footage as possible. It would be good to use different transition styles and effects to keep the video interesting......I can provide you a list of songs that the wife and the deceased man played at the funeral once the job has been awarded.
