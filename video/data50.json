In the attached material we are sending you to the autocad file the general plan with the construction phase and the 3D of the area with objects if it needs to be detailed because it is gross material. In the autocad material we have also set the field cuttings and type of siege. Also in pdf we are sending you to create plane plans with the map of Tirana showing the roads and positioning of the new landfill. We are sending you photos from the area to the existing state. We have generated from 3d that we have made some renderings that we have processed in the photoshop and are starting as a reference and for the quality and to create the object idea. We want to realize an animation of the entire area and the road when a truck enters the landfill and unloads the remains. We want to have a lot of greenness and detailed plans. This animation will be presented in the media and will be our basic advertising for this reason we want a more animated and high quality professional animation.
