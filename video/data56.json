We call this the 'harness'. The kits can be viewed on our website at [url removed, login to view]I would think the best way to approach this is to show a skeleton bungalow with the bedroom and the loft space visible.The first job is to tidy the work space and remove loft insulationThe light source is usually housed in the loft space with the source as close as possible to the centre of the fibre optic display. So, the animation should show electric cable snaking into the loft from the room below, a socked attached to the cable and a switch to the end in the room below.The next step is to drill (in the case of our Orion kit) 120 holes in the celling, this could be animated showing that drilling from below or above is acceptable.When the drilling is finished then the fibres from the harness can be inserted into the holes. The fibre harness is inserted into the light source and the fibres run neatly to the holes. The loft will have ceiling joists so the fibres could be shown snaking over, under or through the joists. If necessary holes can be shown to be cut through the joists.Next a dab of Silicone adhesive is put onto the top of the hole to secure the fibre. When this has dried the loft insulation can be re-laid.Next the fibres are trimmed to about 10mm and the ceiling is painted. When the paint is dry the fibres are cut flush. If you want to repaint the ceiling in the future leave the fibres 3mm long. They can be cut again when the ceiling is re-painted.The last frames will be a twinkly ceiling.I have found an animation style that I  like, the URL will be attached.ThanksJohn", "title": "Website animations"}, {"url": "/projects/video-editing/make-video-14937553/", "desc": "Summarize. Summarizing the project means explaining the aims, outcomes, significance and benefits. You must use 3-5 sentences (or less) for writing the summary. The title of your project is to be placed at the beginning of the paper. Avoid using unnecessary and parenthetic words and expressions.Define. Defining the project means explaining what purpose to reach and what need to address. Under the purpose you write about the main intent for project startup. Under the need you must define the business problem to be solved or the opportunity to be exploited,Justify. Justifying the project means proving that the project underpins some business goals and is significant to success of the performing organization. You must identify business drivers that lead change to the project and determine how the project impacts the performance of the organization.Evaluate. Evaluating means identifying the benefits to be gained upon successful completion of the project. You need to use the results of cost-benefit analysis to explain the ratio between the benefits to be gained and the cost to be covered.Approach. Approaching the project means selecting, approving and describing a method that is efficient for implementing the goals and objectives of the project within the current operational environment. You must have an approach along with a methodology that explains how to phase the project and what lifecycle to be followed.Schedule. Scheduling means performing a preliminary estimation of time needed for the project. You\u2019ll need to develop a timeline that shows the total estimated amount of working hours required. Note that the timeline will be used later during the planning phase to develop the project schedule and estimate activity durations.Wrap. Wrapping the project is a slangy word I use here to explain the need for stating the requirements for your project.

The requirements wrap the project making it limited and bounded in terms of the user expectations.Compensate.
