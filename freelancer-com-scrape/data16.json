They do these by awarding credits to people for:1. sharing the website and recruit new members2. sharing a voucher you've bought and stimulating others to buy the same oneSometimes they'll have these campains where you can receive 5 euro onto your account, these campaigns always work with a 'discount/value'-code you have to enter into your account to redeem the code and add the credit to your account.However, these codes always seem to have the same layout an ar easy to generate yourself (ex. the value code is something like VALUE1586, and another would be VALUE4963, making it easy to just guess a number between 0000 and 9999 to find a working code). Most of the time it only takes me 2 or 3 tries to get a working value code.extra information: anything you buy with this 5 euro value, needs to be priced over 5 euro. You can't buy something of 4.99 for 'free'. (probably so they still make a small turnover). Also you can only win a 5 euro value code once (at least one time per registered account)Comming back to the two marketingtools:1. You can receive 5 euro of credits if you recruit one person (5 euro goes onto your account when te recruit has made a purchase on the website). This with a maximum of 4 recruits or 20 euro.2. When a users makes a purchase and shares his purchase on social media, he can get the initial value of the purchase refunded in credits when there are 3 people that buy the same thing (only when they click trough the shared link that was posted on social media).If you put 2 and 2 together you'll see that I can do following steps to gain free credit into my account:- create an account that shares its recruitment link. (let's call this the MAIN account)- create 4 new accounts using that recruitment link (they wil be worth 5 euros when the have made their first purchase)- add 5 euro per account by trial and errorTHEN-buy an item with the MAIN account that costs 5.25 (So I will need to pay 25ct trough bank tranfer or mobile banking) and share my purchase-have the 4 new accounts make the same purchase using the shared link on social media and their 5 euro of credit on their account.This wil result in me paying 1.25 (for the 25ct that needs to be payed for the MAIN + 4 new accounts) BUT receiving 20 euro worth of recruitment bonus and an extra 5.25 euros for the reimbursment of the original purchase = 25.25 euro (on the MAIN account)I use a temporary mail server to generate new e-mail adresses easily so I can generate these fake accounts.The complete process takes about 30-45 minutes of my time and I would like to automate this so it goes a lot faster and easier. Basically what I do know is production line work, repeating a dozen of steps.I'm looking for someone who can make a tool where I only need the input the purchase that has to be made (the one of 5.25 in the example) and  the tool does the rest (exept for the payments).", "title": "I would like to hire a Programmer", "url": "/projects/php/would-like-hire-programmer-14834582/"}, {"desc": "Maintenance of our android mobile app and updation.", "title": "Mobile App Maintenance", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/mobile-app-maintenance/"}, {"desc": "Need UI components for a native mobile application", "title": "Develope a Mobile screen native UI", "url": "/projects/graphic-design/develope-mobile-screen-native/"}, {"desc": "We need a professional developer/s with good background who can handle both Android and IOS on their native languages for a Mobile Application.

The dolphin should be animated so that it can have different speeds of swimming and jumping out of the water. The control of the dolphin should be done by the player. Here is a simple asset of a dolphin animation. The dolphin in this is to rough from the quality of the 3D Model, but the animations that come with it are a pretty good example:Sample of animated Dolphin:[url removed, login to view]!/content/77844As to the skin of the dolphin you find attached a picture of a photomontage for a dolphin made out of capacitors that I did before.

Depending on who gets more capacitors in a given time, wins.Sample of shark attack:[url removed, login to view]!/content/83894The game should be playable on HTC Vive, with an option to play it on an ipad.However as said before, first step would be a Game Trailer, showing the action of the dolphin and the swarm.

Look at it from time code: 0:38[url removed, login to view]!/content/52103The Game Trailer would be approx. 90 sec.As to the capacitor, client will supply the 3D Model.
