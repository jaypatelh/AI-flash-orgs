Not only does Urbancoms Limited manage the whole of our phone systems in our offices, they also manage the phone systems at those blocks of flats where we have porters phones, lift emergency phones and so forth.We have been working with Urbancoms now for probably something like 10 years. During the whole of that period we have received good service, when there is a fault it is rectified promptly, their technicians have the skills necessary to improve and rectify systems when we need that, and there have always been cost savings when we have transferred a new contract to them.Richard Nubel AIRPM - Knight Frank LLP - June 2016Since we started using Urbancoms our lives have been so much easier if there are problems with any BT lines. We have started transferring a lot more of our blocks over because of the efficiency.The biggest plus for us is when you call Urbancoms you get an answer straight away and not an automated service that ends up putting you to the wrong department where you end up speaking to someone that doesn\u2019t understand the issue.The first time I used them was because a phone line wasn\u2019t working in a lift and normally we would be spending more time on the phone sorting everything out, I called Urbancoms, explained to a very competent member of staff and within 10 mins it was all dealt with and BT were on site first thing in the morning (never ever happened before).This company has helped so much that we can concentrate on other important things.I also know that some of our blocks have raved to the tenants about Urbancoms and how much cheaper they are which is another bonus.I would definitely recommend them to do business with any of our sites.Lesley Richards - HML Hawksworth - June 2016", "title": "Create  copy for PDF", "url": "/projects/content-writing/create-copy-for-pdf/"}, {"desc": "I need an Android app.  I would like it designed and built.
