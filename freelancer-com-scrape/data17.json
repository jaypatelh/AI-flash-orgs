Due to bandwidth constraint and dynamic topology ofmobile ad hoc networks, multipath supported routing is a veryimportant research issue. This paper proposes a NetworkCoding-based AOMDV routing algorithm in MANET(NC-AOMDV). It is typically proposed in order to increase thereliability of data transmission or to provide load balancing. Inour simulation, we compare NC-AOMDV routing protocol withAODVM routing protocol, in terms of the packet delivery ratio,packet overhead, and average end-to-end delay when a packet istransmitted. The simulation results show that the NC-AOMDVrouting protocol provide an accurate and efficient method ofestimating and evaluating the route stability in dynamicMANETs", "title": "Network Coding-based AOMDV Routing in MANET", "url": "/projects/php/network-coding-based-aomdv-routing/"}, {"desc": "Circuit designer of mobile phone", "title": "Mobile development", "url": "/projects/supplier-sourcing/mobile-development-14808021/"}, {"desc": "We are a mobile advertising company and looking for someone who will design out Booth Posters for an exhibition.Size : 2500X1200 and 3000X1200", "title": "Dmexco Wall Posters", "url": "/projects/graphic-design/dmexco-wall-posters/"}]
