The context is defined based on the student profile (level of study and preferences) and the object he is exploring. Identification of objects is based on the student GPS location and image processing techniques to increase the object identification accuracy. The system follows the instructor-led learning approach where instructors should visit the location first and define objects of interest as landmarks on the location map, then create a repository of learning materials for the selected objects for different levels of study and for different learning styles. During the field trip, the student location is monitored to identify the nearest objects and when the student directs his mobile camera to a specific object, the object is identified and learning materials based on the selected object and the student profile will be presented.  The instructor visits the field trip place first to locate objects, he connects to the Internet then turn on the application and define objects as landmarks on the map. Then he returns back and uploads educational material on the repository via the desktop/web application for each object according to the student level and style. He can upload different types of learning materials (video, text, ppt, image, animation, etc.) and different contents based on the different levels of study of students. These materials will be accessed later by the students during the field trip. When the student goes to the field trip, he connects to the Internet then runs the application. The application will show a map for the location with landmarks for the suitable objects for him. He can move to any object with the guide of the map to explore it. If he needs more information, he selects the object and takes a photo of it. The application will show learning materials that are relevant to the object and to the student so that he can explore them.", "title": "An Interactive Context-Aware M-learning System for Field Trips", "url": "/projects/education-tutoring/interactive-context-aware-learning/"}, {"desc": "I need an Android app.  I would like it designed and built.
