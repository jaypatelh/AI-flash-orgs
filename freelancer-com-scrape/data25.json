It's just a small tweak on ur part, so it's not gonna be a big job.You have to understand CSS and liquid. Liquid is an open-source template language created by Shopify and written in Ruby. It is the backbone of Shopify themes and is used to load dynamic content on storefront.If you see my store and choose one of the product detail page, you will see that when you scroll down the page, the description stays fixed and it makes visitor difficult to see the tabbed description. Now I dont want this to happen. What I want is the description goes down too, so that visitor can easily see the tabbed description (and clicked them, of course).It would be nice too if you can make that visitor dont have to scroll all the way down the pictures just to see the bottom of the page. So you will have to make two scrolls, one for the pictures, one for the descriptions. When visitor finish scrolling down the description, it will continue to the bottom of the page (which are related product and footer).Please keep in mind that every changes you do on the website SHOULD NOT affect visibility/design on mobile phone view.Please check the website:[url removed, login to view]And please let me know your star sign in the beginning of your proposal so that I know that you are not just copy paste the proposal and have fully read the project description.Thank you", "title": "Tweak Shopify Theme", "url": "/projects/website-design/tweak-shopify-theme-14599679/"}, {"desc": "Hi thereLooking for a WordPress pro to tweak my WordPress site on mobile.
