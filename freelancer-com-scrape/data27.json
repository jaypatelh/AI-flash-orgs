Once done they select the Event  in No 2They are then taken to a screen as seen on \u201cAtt 4\u201d which has time slots with 4 places in each slot, they select an empty slot and click save. If they are an individual then it will obviously fill one slot, if they booked for 3 people then it will fill 3 slots ect, they cannot book for more than 4 people. On the \u201cCalendar\u201d one can see who has already booked for what time and ADMIN has the ability to move Members to different times.Once ADMIN is happy they confirm the Event as can be seen on \u201cAtt 5\u201d, this appears under the REMINDER page of their site from here Admin starts typing in the Competition Name and when he clicks on \u201cSend Booking Confirmation\u201d it sends a SMS (Using [url removed, login to view] as the service provider) to each member that has booked for the competition and it States that they have been booked and gives the competition name and the time they are booked for, it also sends a mail.
