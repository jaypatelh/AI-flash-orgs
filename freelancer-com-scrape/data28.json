Dear Sir/Madam,I am emailing you regarding an application that me and my team are looking to have developed professionally.Our app idea uses an NFC reader connected to a shops EPOS till via usb which could be used to transmit receipts onto the customer's phone, rather than them receiving a physical copy of it. So once the customer touches their NFC enabled device onto the reader, the receipt is stored on the app. The app should be able to detect the store that this receipt was given at, and sort the receipts by store and by date of purchase.The app should also have knowledge of each stores returns policy and give notifications when this is due to expire. For example, if store X would allow you to return the goods within 14 days, the app would give you notification running up to this to warn you how many days are left. There should also be the stores returns policy in that section. We can provide the return policies and times.We would like to know the technical viability of this. We are trying to replace the conventional receipt printer which is connected to the EPOS till by a NFC reader which instead of printing it, will put a digital copy on the phone.I have linked below details of the USB NFC reader and have also linked a copy of the SDK. Please click on the link to access these :[url removed, login to view]Please inform me if this link does not work.We can provide this reader for testing if necessary.We would also like to know a cost, be it approximate or accurate, of the whole project.We would also like to know whether this would also require some extra software alongside the NFC reader connected to the EPOS till to work.Also how would this work with different EPOS version tills, can we make a universal program or one program for each type of EPOS till?We would also like to know if this will be available on iphone as well as android, with the recent news that apple has introduced NFC capabilities into the iPhone 7 and above and introduced the core NFC framework.
