This should be made quick to load3) After few seconds all the images disappear. This issue needs to be fixed.4) Images on entire website don't look good. And look dull. Probabbly because I have to upload smaller size images. I should be able to upload better images and they should still load faster with some compression etc...5) In Registration, auto activation should be implemented. Currently an email goes to email id for verification. Instead of that each registration should be auto activated. Verification email should be still sent, just to verify email id.6) In Admin Panel, I should be able to attach specific products to another product. So when someone buys that another product, those specific products will be restored to his account automatically7) Website should store USD and AUD currencies valid at the time of customer payment. This information should be also be included in notification email to Admin with any discount applicable in both currencies. In Admin Panel -> Orders -> That Order should also accurately show exactly the amount with discounts if any with a possibility of choosing AUD or USD as currency and the order detail on that page will show invoice and values in that currency.8) Admin Panel -> Orders -> A Particular Order page -> When clicked SEND/SUBMIT, an invoice email with PDF attachment should be sent. Currently only invoice email goes in HTTP format without any PDF attachment.9) On Training Schedule and on Online/Onsite training product detail pages expired or ended training records show up, which shouldnt show up. Only current or future training records should show up there.10) On Blog detail page, Comments should be immediately listed below the blog. And other items like related blogs etc... should be shown at the bottom. Also Blog detail pages and Blog home page have issues with Like/Dislike and Comment links. They are very slow. This needs to be fixed.11) Admin and front end need to be modified so that on product detail page, I'm able to show related products with similar icons such as on products page. (Currently I'm showing related products as text and links and table within the product details page)12) When I add a new training date to a training, then sometimes one of the tables is not updated properly. This needs to be fixed. Also I'm unable to delete users from training events. When I remove a user from list and save, it should remove user from all the 3 or 4 related tables13) In Admin Panel -> CMS -> Trainings -> A particular training for a particular user, there should be a button to make all past, current and future training dates & their recordings available or unavailable for that user. There is one table where two records are responsible for it. 0 means not available and 1 means available.
