The image placeholder opens up the image-upload dialogue when clicked.After uploading an image the resolution will be checked for printability and a cropping option will apply to choose a custom cutout with the correct aspect ratio.At the end of the process we need a printable PDF file (300dpi / cmyk) that is submitted to us with the custom designed sedcard of our client.We think its best to use mpdf/fpdf for the pdf generation, but we are also open for suggestions.Our website is based on wordpress with woocommerce. The sedcard product needs to be taken to the cart when its finished and the order process should be the standard woocommerce procedure.The generated PDF needs to be attached to the order and also sent by email.The client can choose if he wants just a downloadable pdf file or if he also wants the card to be printed by us.

Please read the description completely and be willing to assist in building the team first and presenting with me to the client a clear plan, budget and time-frame for the project prior to first payment.  The job is needed, it is ours so long as I find the super-star right-hand man or woman who can run the team and assist me with client questions and presentation.Alright, guys and gals, my client runs a popular cloud crypto mining website and is looking to branch out into a standalone desktop console and GUI miner with the possibility of some mobile variation dependant on a further feasibility investigation.   The desktop miner which links to the site much like NiceHash or Minersgate will need to be able to handle both AMD and NVidia graphical processors as well as a broad range of CPUs in leveraging hashing power from the common home desktop and laptop machines. Support for GPU farms and rigs is desired as well.  The clients' current site offers live cloud mining (hash rental) and the exchange of around 20 cryptos currencies on 4 or 5 different algorithms.  They run mining farms in different areas of the globe to facilitate this business and all of the current infrastructures will need to be accommodated in our prospective design.  The client would like to start offering in-browser CPU mining as well.  The site is currently running on an asp.net framework and our products will need to seamlessly interact with their current system or be able to at least get along well enough for automation purposes.  This will be a big project and I will need the following:A senior full-stack developer who can oversee all of the other hires from a technical and architectural standpoint, present creative and original ideas for my approval to take to the client with a budget and time frame.  This can and likely will lead to more and/or continuous work in the related industry and I would like to find a lead person whom I can rely on for future projects as well.In addition, the Lead will assist me in choosing the remainder of the team.  My background is primarily in graphic design and printing, however, I have an adequate technical knowledge to oversee the business end of things.  My lead will be my go-to for addressing concerns regarding EVERY aspect of the project and along with myself will interact directly with the client and his team.  So my lead will need a broad and strong set of skills with proven experience on large cross-platform projects:+)  UI and UX person/people and graphic designer+)  Backend .net and C++ people, preference is given to those with reverse engineering experience+)  CUDA and/or Open CL expert(s)+)  Full stack web/mobile pro or twoAlso any other position the lead convinces me we need.I do not have a set budget as of this moment however the client is doing very well and is expansion-minded.  As the contractor, I will be paid by the client in BTC as they have the majority of their working capital in that form.  I will give you your choice of either Fiat or BTC, however, I am discussing timeline and benchmark bonuses with the client for the team which will be paid in BTC.Moving forward from this initial project the client would like a full-service crypto-exchange built next so this is a good opportunity for those with the correct skill sets who have lots of availability and can potentially be an on-going member of teams for projects I bid to customers.I am looking for my senior project leader first, however, I am happy to hear what anyone has to offer.Write me and tell me why you are my perfect ___________Your background is in ________________________________________What can you offer this and future projects that others can't?______________________", "title": "I need a team with the right blockchain pro's ,C/C++ backend developer, UI and UX designers, OpenCL or/and CUDA developer pluse a Full Staker to run the team", "url": "/projects/project-management/need-team-with-the-right/"}, {"desc": "I need a mobile site.

When we say \u201cfull functionality\u201d, we mean the same type of standard functionality we see in typical adult tube sites \u2014 with the added ability to play 360 VR video.
