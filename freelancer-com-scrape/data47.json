Importantly, please Ensure that you check, revamp, and fix the speed issues across all Major Desktop Browsers and across all Major Mobile Phones/systems like iPhones & Android etc. (If necessary, please advise if you need any information or guide from the Host). b) Please upgrade any mods and the script itself as necessary... please be very careful as Not to affect any SEO settings in any way, specifically the 'Yoast' add-on. 2.

So, to avoid any confusion, when the person hits \u2018Send\u2019, as soon as the \u2018Send\u2019 button is hit, can you then make this button say \u2018Sending...\u2019 You can do this change within the \u2018Send\u2019 button\u2019s current style & colour.
