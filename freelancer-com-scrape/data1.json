I can't get into my usual Freelancer account so contacting you through here. Over the past few months we experienced quite a few errors going on with the website and need these rectifying please. Many the issues are with the Mobile site you did most of the work to. The main issue is the menu button to the top (pink/purple) bar on each page is not working. Also the video on the top of the landing page is not working etc. I had our web host company look at this and they couldn't find out what's happening. Obviously I'm hoping that as you did the work its a simple fix (for which I'm obviously happy to pay).Please can you advise if you are happy to do this? Also there are several other things that need sorting to. The new voucher page you did stopped working and we had to revert to the old voucher page for now.
