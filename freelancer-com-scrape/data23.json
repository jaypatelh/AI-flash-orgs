I would like this software to be developed . DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECTDevelopment of computer vision systems for a supermarket (analog Amazon Go) Terms of Reference: It is necessary that buyers at the entrance to the store open a mobile application, the application generates a QR code for each account, the QR code will be a ticket to enter the store. Buyers making various purchases, all displayed on the mobile application (for example, if a person takes a product from him displayed in a mobile application, what exactly he took, if a person changes his mind and put the product back on the shelf, he has a minus application in his mobile application) That would be full integration of the machine vision, the mob application (iOS / Android), turnstiles at the entrance, RFID tags, scales, payment. It is proposed to place turnstiles 3 at the entrance, 3 at the exit. The customer enters the store making various purchases, Products may be to stuff his pockets, backpack, bag, etc. And quietly left the store, when exiting through the turnstile, equip the turnstiles with sensors / scanners that must accurately scan the RFID tags, which accurately determine the price of the goods typed. Upon withdrawal, withdrawals must be made from a bank card. Also, it is necessary that the overdraft principle work (For example: if there are not enough funds on the bank card, the client can safely exit, but the lack of funds will be automatically withdrawn when money is received on the Bank card, or care in negative, also it should be noted if the person hanging a debt In front of the store, the customer can not go into the store, ie when opening the application's mobile QR code was not generated, the message was issued that the client has a debt in n-sum). After the exit, the customer receives electronic cavitation (the UBER taxi principle). It will be necessary to think over the input for several people (for example, if a husband and wife, friends, parents with children come into the store), and also if a group of people have logged in to one account, the products they purchase are recorded and displayed in the mobile application of the person under whose account A group of people came in. People can go to the store with their products (For example, with their own bottle of drink), I do not think that it will take a lot of work, tk1. There will be no RFID tag2. There will not be a product to stand on the shelf. Not a full-fledged product (bottle floor, open pack, etc.) It is also important that the system would recognize thefts (for example, that adults, children could not take candy chocolate, fruits, vegetables and eat right in the hall, and also if Buyers tore off an RFID tag, or put products without RFID tags in their pockets: candies, fruits, vegetables). The store will be aimed at a paying audience, but such cases should not be ruled out. In the performance of such actions it is necessary that the Security Council immediately become aware of this action. Just do not exclude the various stubs (foil, etc.). It is possible to replace the technology of RFID tags with another method, more accurate, modern. Recognition is necessary for products at weights. Confectionery products, sweets, vegetables, fruits, etc. as these products are purchased at the weights! In any case, these storefronts will be serviced by sales consultants, integration with weights, or with RFID tags is necessary. (In addition, you will need to buy a printer for RFID tags) (For example, in all supermarkets we weigh products and stick a bar code with the price of a bag) It is also important to pay great attention to leaving the store. It is necessary that the system does not give errors (For example, if three different people will go out one by one, so that money can not be removed from one person) CRM. It is also necessary to collect data, statistics! That we could calculate the average check, what in the future could, according to this statistics, create a strategy to increase the average check. Also I would like to add a function, when the customer enters the mobile application that displays the previous purchases on the screen, and asked the customer \"would you like to repeat these purchases\"? Showroom 1500 sq. M. Warehouse 300 sq. M. It is necessary to register the vehicle (preferably step-by-step implementation). Timing (preferably within 12 months) It is necessary to register what equipment is necessary, and also in what quantity! Ideas, other options! As well as idea A, also be kindly written in the form of a technical specification taking into account the necessary equipment.", "title": "Write some software -- 2", "url": "/projects/software-architecture/write-some-software-14656058/"}, {"desc": "We are looking for a friendly customer-oriented professional who could join our team remotely for Customer Care support in French and Spanish.- Professional level of written and spoken: French AND Spanish.
