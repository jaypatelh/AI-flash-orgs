I have no background in doing apps and initially my Final Year Project was removed by my school so I did nothing but they added back my project about 3 weeks ago and nothing has been done, but I need to show something to my professor and need to complete the project in about 3 weeks so I need desperate help in finishing it.I have attached the project details in the document attached. But in summary I am supposed to create a navigation app for any one mall in Singapore. I am thinking between a mall named Jurong Point and a mall named Far East Plaza. Jurong Point doesn't have a floor plan and Far East Plaza does. Jurong Point is actually 2 buildings that is connected whereas Far East Plaza is just one building. You can google these 2 malls and look at which mall seems doable and easier.So the app should let the user to reach the shop if the person is lost in the mall. The app should be able to display advertisements in text or image form when they come near to the shop probably. And the app should show the events happening in the mall and promotions for the respective shops etc. This is in summary. More details are in the document but the document has Jurong Point part only so you can search for Far East Plaza and compareI need this app as soon as possible given the deadline and I am a student who needs desperate help, the requirements are in the document too. Please tell me if you can help me out please??? Looking forward to your reply soon![url removed, login to view]That is the link for far east plaza[url removed, login to view]That is the link for Jurong PointSo basically all the datas are there in the websites already I think and you can compare and let me know which one is better to do as soon as possible and fulfill all the requirements and stuff.An android mobile application for users to use if they are lost in a shopping mall (Either Far East Plaza or Jurong Point). So the app helps the user to direct them to the correct shop in the mall. So it is navigation in the mall.Other than that, displaying the event happenings in the mall.And then displaying the promotions in the mall. If there are no promotions, we can create our own promotion randomly for the respective shops in the form of text or image. So it can be there as a category and when the user approaches the shop he or she wants to go to, then the advertisement (in text of image form) if the shop can appear", "title": "mobile app", "url": "/projects/php/mobile-app-15336576/"}, {"desc": "I need a new website.
