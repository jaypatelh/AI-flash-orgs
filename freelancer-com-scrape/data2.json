The app has four major portions1- \"Video view\" section2- \"Control\" section3- \"Variables view\" section4- \"Graph\" sectionEach section has a different structure and contains different \"type of\" data as compared to other sections. For example,The \"Video view\" section has a control panel with various buttons.The \"Control\" section has various sliders.The \"Variables view\" section has different variables along with their values.The \"Graph\" section shows the graph between any two variables of \"Variables view\" section.To have a better understanding of what the current GUI looks like and the data contained in each section, please find the video attached (at dropbox link).The current GUI is just fine for large screens (Tablets, Laptops etc.) but the problem is when it is run on a small screen (mobile phones with screen sizes as small as 4.3\") because everything is too small to be read clearly etc. etc.So, I want the freelancer to re-design the GUI of the app for me considering the following major points:1- In the current GUI, \"All\" sections are always visible to the user at all times. But this is NOT necessary. Only the \"Video view\" is the one that is needed at all times. So, the freelancer could use hide/unhide buttons or tabs or whatever is suitable for the other sections (Control, Variables view, Graph).2- The buttons in the current GUI have been grabbed from different sources (so they do not give the same feel). He will also design the buttons that give different feel than the others.3- He will also re-design the dropdowns, sliders, scroll views etc.4- The payment for the whole work will be $40.5- Let me know if you have any questions.Regards.", "title": "Re-design App GUI", "url": "/projects/photoshop-design/design-app-gui/"}, {"desc": "I need an Android app.  I would like it designed and built.

They'll be login in from the same exact AppHow It Works:Users will enter the car info (trim level, features, options etc) and Salespeople (here represented by the red screens) will reply with their quotes in real-time. The user will pick whoever salespeople he's comfortable working with and will then finish the deal OFFLINE (outside of the app) with the salesperson.The App will be totally free for now but a fee will be accessed between 6 or 12 months from now to salespeople that successfully complete a sale.Requirements:- The App will require Facebook or Google login- You will be able to use Firebase as server API- A 3rd party API based Soft Credit Check will be provided to you (The app will need it in order to be able to pull users Soft Credit Reports)- We'll need an Admin Panel to review number of deals, users, salespeople; manage users (change, delete, deactivate); cars (add, remove cars).
