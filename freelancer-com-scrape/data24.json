Please read the entire project prior to proposing.Summary of project:I am building a website that will bring together \"individual\" and \"commercial\" sellers of a particular used item, and buyers who are interested in purchasing versions of that used item. Basically, the site will be an online \"classified ads\" marketplace, but specific to one type of product. The final price of the items being sold will be negotiated between the buyer and seller themselves, and the site revenue will be made on a price charged to the seller for posting the \u201dad\".As such, the purpose of this project posting is to seek assistance in building a peer-to-peer (p2p or c2c) \"Classified Ads\" marketplace website using the following criteria:The Classified Ads marketplace will be built using:a) WordPress, including a theme I have already purchased; orb) another platform (at the recommendation of the awardee).Should a bidder propose using the existing WordPress theme already purchased and installed and is awarded this project, they will be provided with the complete zip files, including all the faqs and tutorial files, and will be able to benefit from the \u201csupport\u201d package I have purchased in addition to the theme from the creators, and \u201cediting\u201d credentials to the back-end of the WordPress sitecore;While I would prefer modifying and using the WordPress theme I have already purchased, after reviewing this project completely, bidders on this project are welcome to submit their recommendation of another platform should they believe the project will be better suited and more easily and/or quickly created on another such. However, if another platform is proposed, in order to give it full consideration, as part of their proposal and recommendation the bidder will need to provide additional information, including:- a \"pros and cons\" analysis of both using WordPress vs their recommended platform;- a cost and time analysis it will take to build; and- url's and/or screenshots of other similar sites that have been built using said platform.Some site specifics:The site I am seeking to build will have a user interface very similar to AirBNB(.com) & Turo(.com),  but unlike owners of those site who \u201crent\u201d out their product (homes or cars), our owners are selling the product they own.Visually, the site will give sellers multiple criteria by which they can filter their searches, the primary layout of the screen they will see will be a geo-map oriented. PLEASE SEE THE ATTACHED FILES FOR EXAMPLES of how the site will look like.The site will need to be easily navigable via a regular PC, as well as via tablets and mobile phones (either as mobile friendly websites or as a downloadable app).A more detailed and complete list of specifications will be provided to the awardee.Additional requirements:The awardee will also need to be proficient in graphic design, as not only will they be redesigning the  banner/logo, buttons, and other misc site graphics (basically site branding), but will also be creating some initial social media advertising banners and graphics announcing launch & existence of page.Communication:The awardee will need to be available to chat [Removed by [url removed, login to view] Admin] from time to time during the project, so as to test features out together, and better understand any questions either side may have.Finally, dependent on the quality of work the awardee delivers, they may be given an initial opportunity to work on future projects, including developing a second website, an app, and other IT related projects, so knowledge in databasing and remote software management will be a plus, though not necessarily used in this project.Freelancers who include portfolio links to online projects they previously worked on will be given first consideration.IMPORTANT INFORMATION:NDA and IP Assignment Release will be required on this project.", "title": "Building a Peer-to-Peer Classified Ads Marketplace Website", "url": "/projects/graphic-design/building-peer-peer-classified-ads/"}, {"desc": "I need an Android app.  I would like it designed and built.  578jucilenesantos", "title": "Mobile development -- 2", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/mobile-development-14634031/"}, {"desc": "We are looking a sales people to sale IT product-Meeting Room  Management & Digital Display-Mobile Application Development-AWS & Devops ServicesWe are also looking reseller also, all sales based on commission based.", "title": "Sell something for me", "url": "/projects/sales/sell-something-for-14633845/"}, {"desc": "an app that can find a word on mobile screen , can click on buttons on screen , can swipe left and right and can drag and drop , automatically and will show an example for that", "title": "Write an Android application", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/write-android-application-14631995/"}, {"desc": "I need a mobile site.
