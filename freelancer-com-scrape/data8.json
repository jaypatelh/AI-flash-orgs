With this app, children won't lose or misplace paper money and parents won't have to keep track of allowances and chores by hand.Parents can create a daily, weekly, or monthly allowance for each child. Each child can have their own rate of periodic allowance, or you can give them allowance payments based on the completion of chores, or a mixture of both.Each chore can be a one time chore, or repeated on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule. Each chore can be configured so completion is required for the child\u2019s periodic allowance, or the chore can be configured as an extra reward in addition to their allowance.Through the app, parents can approve or unapprove all allowance and chore payments for up to 30 days.Kids see how much they have saved and when and how much they\u2019ve spent. They can watch their allowance savings grow with the Allowance Graph and see how much savings they'll have in the future. Kids can see what chores need to be done and check them off when completed. Kids can receive chore reminders without having to open the app.The application will be developed in ionic technology (hybrid native + html5) and this first version will be available only on mobile devices.
