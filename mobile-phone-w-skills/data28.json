Each step lasts 0.5 seconds,Idle lasts 1 second, but it's also two steps in game logicThere are five states: Idle, Attack, AttackReturn, Dodge, DodgeReturn, which have respective states in AnimationStateMachine;Combinations of states determine damage dealing and receiving in each state:Idle - Idle: no damage done, no damage received;Attack - Idle: doing the basic damage;Attack - Dodge: no damage done, no damage received;Attack - DodgeReturn: dealing doubled damage;Attack - Attack: both the player and the opponent receiving triple damage;There are four types of gameplay events: Think, Watch, Attack, Dodge.These events are linked to a chain. Events are executed one by one following the chain order by default,but links themselves might change execution order;Think and Watch are correlated with the Idle state, Attack, and Dodge with respective states.* When Think event is triggered, Read the next Link.Replace next Link with a Link of an index calculated based on a number of steps defined by respective event properties forward or backward on the chain.* Watch event also controls the chain execution order.
