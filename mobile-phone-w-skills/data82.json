I am Philip Lam and I have just started learning mobile app development.I am trying to develop a basic mobile app which can get and post data to a server.I have managed to get a very simple mobile app working.Briefly, the mobile app moves some Jsonp and Json around.The back end is an Express Node.js server ([url removed, login to view]).  The data is sent between the front end and the back end by way of jQuery JSON GETs and POSTs.So far, I have successfully gotten the server side to launch and work.  The server also correctly tracks and sends information.  Furthermore, the browser on my PC is also able to detect the server's performance.  All this is working fine.The problem is that when the mobile app is launched into the Android emulation, it does not respond at all to any clicks on the mobile app.  On the other hand, the browser on the Android emulation (when directed to [url removed, login to view]) does show the correct response from the server.  That is, clicking on the Test JSONP button sends the Jsonp message to the console log and clicking on the Test JSON button sends the Json message to the console log.  (BTW, [url removed, login to view] is the loopback IP address for the Android emulation to access the server which is on the same PC as the emulation whereas 3000 is the port where the server is listening.)I strongly suspect that the problem lies with the Same-Policy Origin and if I am correct, I wish to use whatever means to overcome the problem.  From the code, you wills see that I have already tried JSONP and CORS.  Please debug the code and show me the correct code.The code \"works\" perfectly in that the server is clearly working (since my PC browser and also the Android emulation browser can both \"see\" and track the server).  The problem is that the mobile app itself does not detect or \"see\" the server's responses at all.  In fact, clicking on the buttons in the mobile app results in no response at all.There is a limit to the number of words I can type here so I have put all the code into a word document for your reference.Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.Regards,Philip Lam", "skills": ["Angular.js", "Javascript", "Mobile App Development", "node.js", "PhoneGap"], "title": "Help me Overcome Same Origin Policy problem (I think) in Simple Working Mobile App Developed with Cordova, Node.js, Express"}, {"url": "/projects/php/need-developer-that-build-native/", "desc": "hi all , i need a developer that build native mobile app in android and Iosthe design for the app is ready on PSD .the database is ready. in mysqlthe back-end is ready . in php codeigniterthe hosting is ready .the source code for the mobile app must be send with Clarify document for the database and the code .the mobile app for booking coursesthe total time is : 10daysmy budget is : 680$the Milestones will be :1- when send the apk file of the android app and link to the  back-endthe time : after 3 days.the price : 40$.3- when send the source code of the android app with descrption documentthe time : after 5 days.the price : 300$.4- when send the ios app and link to the back-end for testing.the time : after 9 days.the price : 100$ .5- when send the source code of the IOS app with descrption document and finish of test the project .after 10 daysthe price : 240$.Thank You ,,", "skills": ["Android", "iPhone", "Mobile App Development", "MySQL", "PHP"], "title": "i need a developer that build native mobile app in android and Ios"}, {"url": "/projects/mobile-phone/mobile-development-15402584/", "desc": "I need an Android app.  I would like it designed and built.
