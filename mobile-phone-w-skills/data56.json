Driver and Passenger  Profile Registration and AuthenticationPaassenger and driver  apps should offer social media and email/password signup and login functionality. Creating a Passenger  profile  is required for services that involve mobile payments. Driver Profiles should be verified and approved by the service administrator.Passengers and drivers should be able to easily edit and upload their own profiles: name, address,  cellphone number amd  email. The driver app should  include photo, driver\u2019s license, Police clearance copy  and information about the vehicle (manufacturer and year of production, car class, color, license plate number)  plus a car photo. Both the driver and the passenger should be able to view each other\u2019s profile. With this information, they can recognize each other at the pickup location.2. Driver and Passenger MatchingMatching allows a passenger to automatically connect to the nearest available driver. The algorithm to pick the driver takes into account several factors: locations of the passenger and nearby drivers (Uber shows up to 8 drivers),  driver\u2019s rating record , car models and number of hours the Driver has been driving for that day and time.  The driver has a few seconds to accept the request (Uber gives 15 seconds) before it goes to the next driver.4. NavigationAt the heart of a location-based app like Uber is the technology of GPS tracking, around which everything else is built on. It allows to identify current locations of passengers and drivers, draw paths between them, set pickup and drop-off locations, track the movement of cars and even calculate the cost of the ride and the ETA (estimated time of arrival). All these data sets are sent to the server for further processing and broadcasting to other users in that particular area.At any given time, the locations and deployment of all available Drivers with their number code can be seen on the server side.Passenger can send records of their trip to any other parties with passenger apps.5. NotificationsUse Firebase Cloud Messaging for Android and iOS.6. Computing and displaying the cost of a rideBoth the driver and the passenger should know the estimated fare in advance.  Calculating the actual fare of the trip is performed on the server-side. It may involve the following parameters and factors: the distance between pickup and drop-off locations, cost of fuel, possible discounts, car class, traffic and weather conditions, peak -hours pricing.7. PaymentsMost payments will be on cash basis based on the estimated cost of travel.We will later chose a card payment system and  we will provide you with the required technical details  for payment integration.8. Rating and feedbackPassengers and drivers should be able to rate each other after the trip is over.  Drivers with low ratings will eventually not be able to use the service.  Passengers should also be able to provide feedback on their experience during the trip. This feedback will be shown in the driver\u2019s profile for others to view.9. Booking and payments historyBoth drivers and passengers should be able to view detailed statistics about previous trips from their profiles: date, time, cost, driver/passenger name, car model, pickup and drop-off locations and  ratings.10. Booking cancellationDrivers and passengers should be able to cancel a ride. In the case of a cancellation, a fee may be charged.", "skills": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone", "Mobile App Development", "PHP"], "title": "Taxi Booking Apps (similar to Uber) for Android and ioS", "url": "/projects/php/taxi-booking-apps-similar-uber/"}, {"desc": "Development from a complicated Sports App in iOS & Android.Implementation from Xd Prototyp.", "skills": ["Android", "iPad", "iPhone", "Mobile App Development", "PHP"], "title": "iOS & Android  Sports App, Programmierer/Developer WITH German & Englisch Language", "url": "/projects/php/ios-android-sports-app-programmierer/"}, {"desc": "Im getting some error while do setup Actor server in Ubuntu 14.04must have exp as andriod dev & Actor server", "skills": ["Android", "Linux", "Mobile App Development", "Ubuntu", "XMPP"], "title": "Actor messaging Server Expert  -- 2 - 02/11/2017 09:00 EDT", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/actor-messaging-server-expert-edt/"}, {"desc": "I need an expert IONIC 2 and Angular 2 developer I will pay $500 per month for both designing and development of the app in android and iOS , if you are expert and Indian then only apply .", "skills": ["Angular.js", "HTML5", "Ionic Framework", "Mobile App Development", "PhoneGap"], "title": "Need Ionic 2 and Angular 2 Developer urgently", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/need-ionic-angular-developer-urgently/"}, {"desc": "Build 2 related mobile apps using React Native, needs to be connected to a laravel project using a restful api, details will be given later", "skills": ["Laravel", "Mobile App Development"], "title": "Hire a React Native Developer", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/hire-react-native-developer-15544525/"}, {"desc": "I have designed a travelling app and I need someone to develop it for me.", "skills": ["App Developer"], "title": "I need an app developer", "url": "/projects/app-developer/need-app-developer-15544510/"}, {"desc": "We need online chat with multi users (php) and also integrate with android", "skills": ["Android", "Mobile App Development", "MySQL", "PHP", "Software Architecture"], "title": "Online Chat", "url": "/projects/php/online-chat-15544386/"}, {"desc": "Need to be able to populate each tab with a description of the tab in the detail text view.

Regardless of this, there are some animal species that are in included as must haves eg bees dung beetles. These must haves would be central for the fate of the survival of your earth.-PEOPLE-Players must decide if people are necessary to earth and if they add them it will show them the impact that we have on earth etc: the computer generated people will get choose depending on their personality age gender and where in time they are etc:Litter or notElectric or petrol carsBuild cities or live in villagesIt is up to the players to decide for the people or not.-PLANT SPECIES-Players must decide what plants are necessary for the sustainability of the earth. While these are still optional, there will be some must haves species, as with the animals, players can choose presant day or survival of the animals people and topography of the planet.While the above is a brief introduction to my ideas for an app that simulates the building of a person's own earth there are many more ideas and layers to my plans.
