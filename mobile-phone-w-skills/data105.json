User Logs in to the appb. User selects category of Surveys - Homes, Vehicles, Businesses, Monuments (4 for now)1. The user creates a new Record (Add Survey - gives name)2. The user takes pictures (5-10) with GPS coordinates embedded;3. The user fills out about 10 data fields (a few drop down and mostly text);4. The user submits the survey (Data and images).5. If the user does not have network connectivity - the app saves the records locally on the phone.6. When they get connectivity the can upload the records.7. Finally I should be able to go on a web page to see submitted surveys: by user and all the data including GPS cords per image.8.

For the slide mats, the user will have to walk to a hardware store and once again, purchase the mats with coins. As for the bath tub, the user will have to walk to Jay\u2019s house and take the bath tub. The bath tub will either re-generate in 24 hours or that can be sped up using the premium currency, \u201cYouTube Money\u201d. \u201cYouTube Money\u201d will be earned slowly, and many can be bought via in-game purchases.For stage 2, once the user has collected the materials needed, they will travel to the area this video is shot at. In this case, the user goes up a mountain and builds the set-up at the top. This is done with the hit of a button, however there will be a timer. The first timer will be 30 minutes, and will increase with each level. The timer can be skipped by using YouTube Money, or by watching an ad. Each ad watch skips 30 minutes.For stage 3, once the timer has run out, the user will then play the level. So in this case, the user will literally be sliding down a long slip and slide that may last for a minute, or longer. On the way down, they will have to remain on the slide by using the analogue sticks, and collect as many coins and the occasional YouTube Money as they can. If they fall off the slide, they fail. If they hit something in their way like a cactus or a hedgehog, they fail. If they fail, they have to keep trying again until they successfully complete the level.So, every level, and lets say there will be 20 in the initial launch of the game, will go a little something like that. There may be a special level where a new environment has to be developed, like a haunted level where the user has to escape from a haunted building, like Denbigh Asylum: [url removed, login to view]Some other ideas we have been discussing for the game:-The game will feature shattered bones and a damage indicator, to heal the user has to travel to the hospital and pay using coins.-After certain levels where something illegal was performed, the user may have an interaction with the police and has to take them on in a fight.-Clues will be left around the map for finding certain resources-The game should feature very enticing sound effects, bright colours, and make every goal reached feel like a special event, for example, coins flying over the screen and a ding sound when a level is completed. All transitions in the game should be fluid.-Characters should be able to unlock and perform stunts, as you progress through the game. Performing stunts on a slip and slide will earn more coins etc. You learn more stunts by hitting certain goals when playing a level, or can buy them with YouTube Money.-Game should include an off-brand energy drink that sends you crazy / helps you earn 4x points/speed for example, can only drink 1 per day.-We like the idea of online connection, and being able to see others playing the game, however would like to know more about the reality of this, for example if there are a lot of players in one area and if it would add a significant amount to the project cost / server strain.This is about all we have so far, as I said, we\u2019re looking to develop these ideas into a reality, into a 3D game available for iPhone and Android.[url removed, login to view][url removed, login to view]", "skills": ["Game Development", "iOS Development", "Unity 3D"], "title": "Develop a 3D free roam mobile game"}, {"url": "/projects/ios-development/app/", "desc": "\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u505a\u5f69\u7968APP\u5957\u58f3\u4e0a\u67b6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u9700\u6c42 logo\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u540d\u79f0\u3001\u6807\u9898\u3001\u4ecb\u7ecd\u56fe\u3001\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u3001\u63cf\u8ff0\u9700\u8981\u7528\u6211\u7684\u3002\u5bf9\u63a5\u6781\u5149\u63a8\u9001\u6d88\u606f\u529f\u80fd\uff08\u6ce8\u82f9\u679c\u4e0a\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u7684APP\u5fc5\u987b\u517c\u5bb9ios7.0\u7248\u672c\u6216\u80058.0\u4e0a\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u7684APP\u5fc5\u987b\u663e\u793a\u6211\u4eec\u6307\u5b9a\u7f51\u5740\u5185\u5bb9\uff09[Removed by admin]", "skills": ["iOS Development"], "title": "\u5f69\u7968APP\u5957\u58f3\u4e0a\u67b6\u4f63\u91d1\u4e30\u539a\u80fd\u505a\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u6211"}, {"url": "/projects/mobile-phone/mobilutveckling-15237887/", "desc": "I need help to get into a emplyes mobil.
