In the case of a student visa, there are many steps the student must complete in the application process. The purpose of the app is to guide each  applicant through the application procedure relevant to their visa choice.The second aspect is to develop a planning app. This app will have different categories of check lists that travellers (students) would need to undertake for their preparation to come to Australia. It would have different sections e.g., Money, Visa, Flying and arriving, Accommodation, Tickets, Insurance, Packing, etcContent for each section might include:Flying and arrivingBook flight.Book accommodation, and confirm check-in time.Coordinate pick up or transportation after arrival.Confirm flight time.Confirm when you will need to leave for the airport.Get directions or check that comes up on your GPS device both to the departure airport and from your arrival airport to your final destination.Coordinate rides or look into parking options.Grocery shop for snacks. If desired, bring an empty water bottle to fill up once inside the security checkpoint.Check luggage number and size (dimensions and weight) restrictions and fees.Decide whether you will check baggage.Make sure you have a quart-sized Ziploc bag and three-oz. or less size containers that fit in that bag.If desired, check in 24 hours in advance.Each sub-heading would have it's own checklist of things that need to be done so the student can keep track of their preparation.
