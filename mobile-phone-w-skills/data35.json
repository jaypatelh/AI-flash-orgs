I think it is pretty much self-explanatory.More specifically, I need the app to have the followings enables:1- It should support different languages. It can be built for English and I can modify it for other languages myself.

So the user cannot rank one person more than once in a day.The design is of course not final and needs lots of work, but the functionality is pretty much the same.
