Add friends, add notes to friends that you owe money to or they owe money to you, a simple payment system where people can purchase coins via visa/mastercard instantly, top up their account balance by simply purchasing more coins, then send to other phones via their bitcoin address or unique wallet address.The idea is basically creating like a human wallet where people would have once handed money to friends to borrow via cash/fiat, now they can send money in the form of coins to other friends, track the transactions, monitor if friends owe them, track which friends owe what and be able to send reminder notifications to friends when they are late paying you. The concept is to be able to send it not just to friends locally but to loved ones and friends anywhere in the world, with no fees except a built in certain coin transaction fee that enables myself as the manager to receive a commission on each transaction, but allows friends and family to avoid paying large transaction fees sending overseas etc if someone is on holidays and gets low on cash. It can then be transferred via the App from the local coin, into a BitCoin price and then sent to a BitCoin ATM to withdraw back into Fiat Currency if required, or using a BitCoin ATM, send to the Application and transfer the BitCoin into my own Apps Coin again. The idea is to make the process of sending and receiving digital currency easy, simple and friendly by also integrating social network platforms or even access to your own mobile phone list to add friends via their mobile number. I would have my own Blockchain and Coin, using the App as a miner as well to help generate extra coins for users the longer they use it, so basically rewarding the user for continuing to use the app. The App can be downloaded via Apple or Andriod, have a website that easily allows you to find the App, what its about and how it can benefit the user, and a back end for myself to access and receive the generated coin fees in my own business wallet that I can then transfer into BitCoin as well, and transfer this then to my own personal wallet or address to withdraw when necessary.Hopefully you can kind of picture what I am after, would be interesting to see what could be achieved, how it could be implemented and what the final product would look like.", "skills": ["App Developer", "Bitcoin", "Blockchain", "eCommerce", "Ethereum"], "title": "Blockchain App + ICO + Website", "url": "/projects/ecommerce/blockchain-app-ico-website/"}, {"desc": "grocery shopping with delivery to homes", "skills": ["Android", "iOS Development"], "title": "application", "url": "/projects/android/application-15800416/"}, {"desc": "I need an app for android, an M3U playlist app, that is an app for IPTV, this app should generate a unique ID for each client so that we can add the list remotely.", "skills": ["Android", "App Developer", "Freelance", "Mobile App Development"], "title": "I need a freelance developer", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/need-freelance-developer-15800379/"}, {"desc": "This project is in its earliest stages.

Victor and Val, our user friendly accountants, who share the journey into guiding the user through the functionality of each feature on the \"My Accountant\" application tool.The objective of \"My Accountant\" is to encourage the user to make partial and/or full payments to their bill companies by allowing the application tool to calculate a series of\u00a0 numerical amounts that equal to the pre-selected grand total entered by the user.This application tool targets those who are not willing to give up their good or bad habits that prevent them from paying their bills, so why not meet them halfway. Studies show that when people voluntarily do things, they have a sense of control over the situation. Now, when a person voluntarily does something and is rewarded, it not only makes that person feel a sense of control, but also boosts their emotional well being. A boost in a person's well being makes them feel secure, meaningful, happy, and motivated which leads to a more productive lifestyle.\u00a0\"My Accountant\" application tool allows making a partial payment successful, which will result into the user feeling if though they have somewhat bounced back from failure. Studies show that a small accomplishment shares a equal sensation of success as a huge accomplishment. Voluntarily putting in effort is good for both mental and physical health. People who voluntarily put in effort are happier and experience less depression. The act of financial donations activates the dopamine-mediated euphoria in our brain that gives us pleasure. My Accountant pleases the user's mind by lifting the feeling of guilt, when a user cannot make a full payment.How  does it work: PHASE I: Step 1) Choose an Accountant Characture \"Victor or Val\"?. Step 2) Type: Your Name, Address, and Contact Number (PHASE 2 Features: Add Bank Information i.e. roating number and checking account number or card to be charged on file.). \u00a0Step 3) Choose a date to save on a calendar to pay those Billing accounts \u00a0Step 4) Add or Subtract Billing Accounts to billing list which includes: billing account names, numbers, address, and notes. NEXT page, will show the billing accounts listed with blank amounts to the right. Step 5) Type in Grand Total (The total amount of bills you would like to pay.) I.e. $500.00 worth of bills.Step 6) Click \"Calculate\"Step 7) Decide if the automated calculation of each amount is feasible per billing account. (If not feasible, click \"Calculate\" to recalculate each automated billing account amount until feasible). NOW, \u00a0If a specific amount for a billing account is required, i.e. user must make a payment of $150.00 for Car Insurance. Go to Car Insurance. Delete previous automated amount. Type in \"$150.00\" then click \"S\" for Save located next to the amount. Then, click Calculate. The \"$150.00\" will remain and the other amounts will recalculate around the \"$150.00\". Once satisfied with the automated amounts for each billing account, then Click \"Save Bill List\". *User Options after \u00a0Save Bill List: The bill list will be saved to a specific calendar date choosen by the user, users can print out this bill list with amounts, Or user can jump straight to \"PHASE 2\". \"PHASE 2 Features\": Click \"Pay Now\". Each Billing account amount or the Grand Total will be withdrawled from the user's bank account or card that has been placed on file.Users will receive a confirmation email of payments received\u00a0 from My Accountant or User can see the bank account withdrawls from their Banking Institution. \u00a0*I want this app to be user friendly and simplistic.
