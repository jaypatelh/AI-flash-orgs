[{"desc": "I have an idea to create an app or computer game based on building a world where players have to create a sustainable planet. This game is designed to teach individuals the effect that their choices have on the planet, the roles of different ecosystems, and promote sustainability.-SURFACE OF THE EARTH-Players must decide whether earth is a pangea-style planet,or a broken into present day continents or build custom made land masses.-TOPOGRAPHY-Players must decide the choice of topography from mountains, forest, jungles, lakes, deserts rivers, oceans, open planes, etc. this can be custom made or or based on present day formations.-ANIMAL BUG SPECIES-Players must decide which animals species they want to include,as well as where to places them for successful survival. Regardless of this, there are some animal species that are in included as must haves eg bees dung beetles. These must haves would be central for the fate of the survival of your earth.-PEOPLE-Players must decide if people are necessary to earth and if they add them it will show them the impact that we have on earth etc: the computer generated people will get choose depending on their personality age gender and where in time they are etc:Litter or notElectric or petrol carsBuild cities or live in villagesIt is up to the players to decide for the people or not.-PLANT SPECIES-Players must decide what plants are necessary for the sustainability of the earth.

Essentially, these track the financial transactions for each unit, as well as allowing for the creation of Violation letters, communications with owners, collecting dues, providing estoppel details for real estate transactions and other tasks of that nature.Both of our platforms are moving to a cloud-based, per unit billing system that will absolutely destroy our margins, so we are looking for someone to create us a proprietary software program that could allow us to combine the features we need the most into one software program that we'll host on our own Computer Server for employees to access.We would also like a corresponding mobile app that will allow managers to update property information easily on the go.We are a small company, and we really don't have a clear understanding of software lingo, so we're hoping someone can help break this down for us.

If you cannot get the quality work done in 7 days, DO NOT waste my time. It's very important that i need quality guaranteed app within 7 days of awarding project.-----------I am looking to get a private shopify app developed.The app is like this:[url removed, login to view]However above app is too advanced. The app that i want should:1) On install, it should also upload a CSV file called products (which is just a shopify product file)2) If that specific product is sold (based on tag) then it shows in apps dashboard under 'Pending' section.3) [Important part] every product and its variant should automatically be assigned a random SKU number however that same 'random' sku number should be connected to a specific SKU number that we would provide you. So basically it should have an app database. So, when that product is sold, it's random SKU match with the SKU as in database and update a price in user's dashboard under pending (Supplier price )4) The amount due under 'Pending', once paid, move to 'fulfilment' and once we fulfill item, we need a backend from where we can update customer's order as fulfilled and enter tracking information.5) Customer should have option to change information like Address and size of variant while it's in pending and once customer pay for it, we could only received updated information.6) Customer (the one who installed app) should have 'billing' option where he can see all past payments made to us.7) If we issue refund from backend, customer should see it in the app, under that specific order.8) Other functions of same app.9) Paste this line in your comment (I Love My Work) only then i would even read your proposal, this shows you have read the project till here.So there would be an app with dashboard for customer and backend for us. Backend needs to be easy to operate and we should be able to perform action on specific shopify store (who installed our app).Please note these are not all requirements, as i am personally not from technical background, its not possible for me to list all. You need to look at that app and decide.Time Frame: Need this app ready in 7 Days. If you cant do it, let's not waste our time.Milestone Terms: If you have more then 97% project completion records and atleast 50+  (4.8 rank minimum ) reviews, i could do 100% milestone upfront.Project budget includes 1 year of after sales service (AMC) in case if app stop working for ANY reason, you need to update it.
