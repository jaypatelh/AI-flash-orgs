This will be an alpha version and will not be release for commercial use.  It may be used in my own teaching but will not be distributed to the public.The main functions:- Users will use the app to read and organize a virtual library of music books.  They can login, create and organize lists of books, search for books and filter their results, and leave reviews for books similar to Amazon.com.- Users can view a book full-screen and turn pages by swiping (mobile), clicking/tapping on a side of the screen, or using their keypad (left, right arrow keys).- The administrator (myself) can upload books and manage the library.- The administrator can send lists to other users.I have considered building this around an existing CMS platform (Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla) but it is a project beyond my skills and experience.  As this is purely for testing a concept, simplicity, functionality, and efficiency are preferred over appearance and overly complicated functionality.I have consulted for app developers in the past but have never functioned as a project manager or overseen any professional software development.  I'm looking for someone who can ask questions, learn about my vision, and suggest changes as necessary.  Open to any and all feedback, ideas, or guidance with this project.Please also advise - how many hours, weeks, etc. you would expect for something like this.
