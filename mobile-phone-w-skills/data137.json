The mode of authentication is based on users audio.Functional Flow for user registration module:a. During the registration, a user should be present with a screen where they need to fill in the username and choose the type of audio recording he/she wants to perform.b. Once the user chose the type of audio recording they want to perform, the user should be asked to perform the recording n number of times (n samples). n should be a configurable parameter. The user has to record their audio one sample at a time by pressing a start button. Once the audio recording is done the user has to stop the recording. The recorded audio is then sent to the server (audio file). The recorded audio, the associated username, type of audio recording along with date and time should be stored in the database on the server.However, if the user is not happy with the audio recording, then he should be able to cancel the recording and start again.c.  Once the required n samples are stored on the server, a processing step will run on the server. Once the processing step is successful on the server, the user should get a message saying \"Registration done for x type of audio recording for user $username\u201d.

Designing logo for the app.f. You need to have your own Linux server preferbaly with Ubuntu to test the server side code.The app has to be integrated with a server back end which will involve:a. Adding recorded audio and other attributes received over the network to a database.b.
