It is a social game but wont require any 3D graphics. It will operate similarly to Instagram, however it is not a social media competitor.

It is coded in Xamarin C#, with XCode storyboard describing the UI appearance, with all behavior in C#. We have an Android port of an older version of that app, using Android GUI XMLs. To update the Android version, we want all screens coded using Xamarin Forms. This updated app needs to work well on both iOS and Android, at all screen sizes.This contract is just for the screens themselves, including C# \"code-behind\" to layout each screen, especially where the content is \"dynamic\". We will provide the code that needs to run, e.g. when a user clicks a button. You will call our code from your \"code-behind\" C# code for that screen. If our code needs to make changes to any widget, you will provide a method for setting the content of that widget.We will provide the existing iOS Storyboard, and the existing C# \"code-behind\" for each screen. This \"code-behind\" probably only needs minor changes to work with the Xamarin Forms version that you create. Therefore, this contract is primarily about creating each screen layout as a Xamarin Form.To successfully complete this project, you need to be familiar with subtle differences between iOS and Android GUI behavior. You need to be familiar enough with Xamarin Forms to know whether any of the specified screens require writing a \"Xamarin Forms Custom Renderer\", to exactly match the behavior on iOS and Android. For more details on Custom Renderers:[url removed, login to view][url removed, login to view]We have already written and debugged all Android-specific code except the GUI.
