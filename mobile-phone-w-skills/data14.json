First we would start with computers and apple products, then androids. (putting it on Xbox or PS4 would be more difficult, so that will be a process in the future).In order to earn screen time, the child or children would need to exercise for it. This can be done either through a goal of steps for a day (e.g. 10,000), or having their heart rate around a level of good exercise (for children this could be anywhere around 150 beats per minute, maybe more) for 30 minutes or more. This would let children feel like they \u201cearned\u201d their playing time. Making them appreciate it more.Because a competitor, unglue inc. already does this, I have to differentiate a bit. The next part of my app would use the hours the child or children have earned for that day, e.g. 10000 steps=2 hours of game time, and use it in easy to understand financial games. There would be different aspects of this game. And the time for screen time would be used as a currency. Depending on how they do on the 5 financial games, they would either gain more screen time or lose it. The idea here is to combine exercise, a sense of \"earning\" their hours, and basic financial literacy.If you could give me a quote on how much this would cost and the time frame it would take, that would be great.A database would be needed to keep track of the children in each household, who uses what device, how many hours they play, and automate it each week so parent's don't have tofor the financial games part, they need to make it very easy for children to understand. So a stock market game, an investing in commodities game such as good, oil, silver, etc..., a bank loan section where kids can take out time from the bank that they have to pay back with time allotted, and a savings account feature where they can store their unused hours. Also, they earn time from exercise. Either through a certain amount of steps chosen by the parent or through a selected heart rate for 30 minutes.Exercise=time earned for electronic devicesThere would also need to be a feature where parents could schedule homework and dinner time where children cannot access their devices", "skills": ["App Designer", "App Developer", "Augmented Reality"], "title": "Screen management app", "url": "/projects/app-developer/screen-management-app/"}, {"desc": "I need a p2p payment app for cash exchange between people in china and west africaA site like transwap does this for hong kong and Singapore.
