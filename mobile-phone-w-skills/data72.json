Then, students who are looking for an apprenticeship can view these vacancies via a mobile application (app) and apply for them. There are two parts to the project; one is the website that will be used by businesses, and the other is the mobile app that will be used by students.The website to be used by businesses should allow them to:-\tsignup and create an account with a business name, email address and password-\tpost a vacancy with details including: salary, qualification, job title, location, working hours etc-\tbe alerted when a student applies for one of their vacancies, and view the profiles of applicantsThe mobile app to be used by students should allow them to:-\tsign up with a name, password and email address-\tbrowse and search for vacancies-\tpersonalise a profile with information such as a personal biography, qualifications, work experience, career goals etc.-\tview the listing of an apprenticeship (job) and view the profile of the business-\tapply for a vacancy or send an enquiry to the business", "skills": ["Graphic Design", "HTML", "Mobile App Development", "PHP", "Website Design"], "title": "website + app development"}, {"url": "/projects/graphic-design/skilled-mobile-app-designer-needed/", "desc": "We needed Skilled Mobile APP UI Designer to implement online production system.

It would ideally flash the button on the iPad until the server has touched the message on their iPad.The server iPad needs the incoming message to pop up on screen, and make a noise (perhaps every minute?). If they touch the pop up message it would disappear completely, without staying in message center.The kitchen buttons should be adjustable when held.

The main advantage of the system is the customers can check the availability within the restaurant and book tables for number they want. Further, they can order their dishes before they arrive and give approximate time of arrival. Not only that they can pay for the orders before they are physically present in the restaurant. The application should be free to download from either a mobile phone application store or similar services.Restaurant owners can provide their restaurant information using the web based system designed to enter their information. This information would include the name of the restaurant, type, opening hours, prices, address, and etc. This information will act as the bases for the search results displayed to the user. The booking system of the restraints are called by the special gateway system to update the restaurant availability.An administrator also uses the website to administer the system and keep the information accurate and updated. The administrator can, for instance, verify restaurant owners and manage user information. Further, administrator is responsible for adding GPS information of the registered restaurant to the database.Furthermore, the software needs both Internet and GPS connection to fetch and display results. All system information is maintained in a database, which is located on a web-server.The software also interacts with the GPS-Navigator software which is required to be an already installed application on the user\u2019s mobile phone. By using the GPS-Navigator, users can view desired restaurants on a map and be navigated to them.
