Fighting DepressionCompany BackgroundTwo minds technology manages and runs the biggest platform for engineers in the world.  The company is running various programs and Apps for engaging with the users. The Apps by the company are most download engineering apps in the world.Two minds connect and partners with various companies and colleges in the education space providing the education material to the students. It also has a forum which hosts primarily user generated content. Millions of users visit the platform every year to download, read and interact with fellow users on the content.The company has stepped into app utility space and would like to develop a mobile app which would help fight depression in the society. Depression is not caused by a sudden sickness but caused by facing continuous difficulties over a period of time. These difficulties may include work stress, anxieties, troubles in personal life, etc. Like for many other illnesses, health professionals believe that if depression is treated while it is in the early stage, it would be more impactful. However, many times it is too late for people to realise that they are suffering from depression. Sometimes, it gets difficult for family and friends to provide support to people suffering as many does not disclose their medical condition thinking not to bother others. The company would like to develop an app which would pick the signs of depression at an early stage and take assistive measures.Project requirementsApplication SetupUpon installation, the app should record essential details from the user such as name, gender, time to bed, and next of kin. These details will be stored locally and user should be allowed to update them at a later stage.Rate your dayEvery day, the app should remind the user to rate their day at the time recorded for \u2018time to bed\u2019. The rating would be either excellent, good, average or bad. These ratings must be stored in a local database for analysis purpose. The reminder to rate your day can be snoozed if the user is busy during that time.AnalyticsAnalyse the data collected from the user and present a summary of how user\u2019s life is progressing. The analysis can be compared on weekly, monthly and yearly basis. The analysis will help user predict the symptoms of depression at an early stage. The summary and comparison of the analysis must be shown in a graphical format.The project team should refer to these applications to get some idea about showing analytics \u2013 Sleep Cycle, WaterMinder and Seven.NotificationsIf a user rates five or more days as \u2018bad\u2019 in a row, the application should notify the next of kin listed in the app. The aim of this feature is to ensure that family and friends of the user are notified that he/she is feeling low so that they can provide some sort of support.Android Wear SupportOne of the challenge of this app is that users may not regularly rate their day. To maximize user inputs, the project team should develop a feature where those users using smart watches are notified to rate their day through watch. The users should be allowed to rate their day through smart watch app. This data should then be synced with Android mobile app for analysis.Design the UI with a modern and minimalist look with no more than 5 colours used. The project team is required to build an Android mobile app and Android Wear watch app (to facilitate the user input).", "skills": ["Android", "Mobile App Development"], "title": "Mobile development"}, {"url": "/projects/android/multi-distribution-platform-linux/", "desc": "Multi-Distribution / Platform (Linux / Windows / Mac / Android + iOS) Crypto Wallet DevelopmentWe require you to create a universal wallet application for storing, transferring and purchasing a Ethereum ERC20 specification token across several operating systems / devices.Distributions are required for:Web access (responsive for desktop, tablet and mobile)Android Mobile apkiOS Appstore appWindows 7 .exe and installerMac OSX .app file or .pkg installerAs well as multiple wallet address creations, a wallet backup and restore feature will be required also.", "skills": ["Android", "Ethereum", "iOS Development", "Javascript", "Mac OS"], "title": "Multi-Distribution / Platform (Linux / Windows / Mac / Android + iOS) Crypto Wallet Development"}, {"url": "/projects/mobile-phone/android-app-15046013/", "desc": "I've an existing android messenger app, need to add groups feature on that same as whatsapp", "skills": ["Android", "Mobile App Development"], "title": "Android App"}, {"url": "/projects/mobile-phone/ios-app-design-15045978/", "desc": "I need mock up design for iOS app.", "skills": ["App Designer", "App Developer", "Design", "Mobile App Development"], "title": "IOS app design"}, {"url": "/projects/mobile-phone/mobile-development-15045611/", "desc": "I need  an iPhone and Android app. It is called Image recognition apps with voice integration.
