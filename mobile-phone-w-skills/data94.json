(A log out button would need to be added to the settings view of the app)Once the user is logged in, it simply shows a webview. This is all served from the web server. However the user then can select a product from the webview and there are 2 buttons on that page, 1 will download and store some JSON data to an SQLite database on the device. The 2nd button downloads and stores a PDF manual and then would open it with the PDF reader that is already in use in the app (PlugPDF)I can record a video that shows all of this to better explain.Many thanks,Andrew", "skills": ["Android", "Mobile App Development"], "title": "Update an Android App"}, {"url": "/projects/php/form-page-open-responsive-all/", "desc": "data base has to show in admin and  somoene available now to do it in 1hr max my budget is 20$ onlyRegistrationTitle...First Name...Last Name...Nationality...country codeMobile Number...Email...Information...", "skills": ["App Developer", "HTML", "PHP", "Software Architecture", "Software Development"], "title": "form page to open responsive on all tab"}, {"url": "/projects/website-design/need-different-aspects/", "desc": "I need 3 things for my project1.

The client will not have access to the online website, but instead will have an app which they receive their claim updates on, update their own claim details where necessary, and have access to any relevant claim information.From the insurer\u2019s perspective they finally begin their digital path and reduce both their inbound and outbound calls. At the same time they provide their clients a cleaner, happier & more fluid claim experience leading to higher feedback scores.We\u2019d be honored if you were interested in working with us and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.Kind regards,Daniel Austin", "skills": ["App Designer", "App Developer", "HTML", "Mobile App Development", "PHP"], "title": "I want a website and app which can communicate."}, {"url": "/projects/html/food-runners-ltd/", "desc": "I need a responsive website.
