I want a layover on the HR persons body so that it is being tracked, if the viewer looks there (which is good) or looks down at the tips below (which is bad). The game should then count points to gamify how long a person has looked in the supposed way and show a result in the end.2. The person using the device should answer the questions in the video for which they have about a minute of time. Since it is supposed to be used with  google cardboard, the smartphone should record the answers in a folder. So the user can review their answers later.3.
