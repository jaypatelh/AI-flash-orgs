The project consists of: i) an IOS app, ii) an Android app, and iii) an Admin web service and website.Here's how the app works:When students have had a lecture, they are immediately able to go onto the app, click on the particular lecture topic and fill in the feedback questions. These questions are able to be personalised by university departments. Once the feedback questionnaire has been completed, the ratings and/or comments will automatically be sent to that lecturer's account, which will have been made by the administrator (me) already. As the administrator, I will also need to download aggregated reports on these feedback ratings, which can then be sent to appropriate department heads.What I need:The app was made via another project on Freelancer. I am happy with what was made, as it was made for both Apple and Android phones. However, the app can be further refined, and the administrator page can be made more efficient so that module/lecture details can be plugged in quickly. I therefore need someone to 1) peer-review the app and to suggest functional and aesthetic improvements, 2) refine and improve the administrator page, especially so that I can download aggregated reports , 3) ensure that students' initial details are saved so that when the next log in it will immediately show them lecture topics, 4) create user IDs for each account so that any abuse can be traced back and accounts can be deleted, 5) create filters to prevent certain abusive terms, and finally 6) create an 'accessibility mode' for anyone with dyslexia/reading difficulties with a larger font and more distinctive font colours.Further requirements:The deadline for these refinements and improvements is the end of August.Clear communications skills and high level of English proficiency are necessary.These are apps currently on the Android and Apple stores:[url removed, login to view][url removed, login to view]", "skills": ["App Developer", "MySQL", "PhoneGap", "PHP"], "title": "Refine a lecture-feedback app"}, {"url": "/projects/mobile-phone/write-iphone-android-application-14724962/", "desc": "hello i need to create a new social networking application for both ios and android with features like of instagram from scratch.", "skills": ["iPhone", "Mobile App Development"], "title": "Write an iPhone and android application"}, {"url": "/projects/c-programming/pos-uclsmpl-sender-netconnect-returned/", "desc": "I need asstance about connecting verifone VX670 to internet via gprs line,", "skills": ["C Programming", "Mobile App Testing"], "title": "VX670 POS\" UCLSMPL:F:Sender.c|L:00622|netconnect Returned -1 errno is -12\" error"}, {"url": "/projects/mobile-phone/omr-application/", "desc": "Hi ,We are need to develop an application that can be do \"Optical mark Recognition \" .It's Should get the result of processing in just 3 second  (In other words the process of scan the page and get the result should be 3 second )Please who have a demo send the message to talk about it .Best Regards", "skills": ["Android", "Mobile App Development"], "title": "OMR Application"}, {"url": "/projects/mobile-phone/write-android-application-14723533/", "desc": "I want a website and mobile android app for my total makeover .[url removed, login to view]", "skills": ["Android", "Mobile App Development"], "title": "Write an Android application"}, {"url": "/projects/php/app-screeenshot/", "desc": "Screenshots", "skills": ["App Designer", "App Developer", "Mobile App Development", "PHP"], "title": "app screeenshot"}, {"url": "/projects/titanium/titanium-developer-required/", "desc": "Titanium developer required who can work on designs immediately", "skills": ["Android", "Appcelerator Titanium", "iPhone", "Mobile App Development", "Titanium"], "title": "Titanium developer required"}, {"url": "/projects/mobile-phone/create-sharing-economy-mobile/", "desc": "Seeking to develop a delivery and errands mobile application engineered within the same sharing economy space as an Uber or Task Rabbit  technology for devices.
