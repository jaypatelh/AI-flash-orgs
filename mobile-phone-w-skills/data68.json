We couldn't get this, so we rounded all 4 corners. SO, I want to make it 3 rounded corners and make the bottom-right corner sharp.2. KEYPAD - EMOJI TOGGLE:-We have an emoji icon to display emojis, but to toggle back to the keyboard, we made another \"ABC\" icon.However, what I want is to remove the \"ABC\" icon. So, to toggle back to the keypad (while on emoji display), just tap on the text field.3. IMAGE SENDING VIA CHAT:What we have now is When you send image via chat, the images are distorted. Stretched or squashed.What I want is to fix the image distortion and allow for the ability to select multiple images and edit the images before sending; like; pencil on it, crop and send full resolution image.4. MESSAGE HISTORY DISPLAY:What I have now is, when you open a friend's chat page, Your old message history does not display your latest message. You have to slide/scroll up a few messages up to be able to see the last message sent.What I want is that, Once you open the message page it should display the latest chat history.5. CHAT HISTORY FUNCTIONS:I want to add the function that, when you press the chat speech/text balloon, you should see options to; DELETE, COPY, FORWARD and probably, recall the message. We don;t have this functions yet.======FEEDS SECTION (Like TWITTER)1. We have a Custom image layout display - But again, the images are distorted (Stretched and squashed). We want this fixed.2. The app crashes when you try to access phone's album or take a pic to post. So we want this fixed and add the functions to take instant pic or take short video and post.We have all the UI done and set.
