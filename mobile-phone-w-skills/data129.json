The softphone allows the user to place and receive calls without requiring an actual telephone set. Often a softphone is designed to behave like a traditional telephone, sometimes appearing as an image of a phone, with a display panel and buttons with which the user can interact. To communicate, both end-points must support the same Voice-over-IP (VoIP) protocol, and at least one common audio codec.There are several companies offering their softphones for Android and Iphone and some of them are also offering Software Development Kits (SDK\u00b4s) to let others to use their developments with the fully customizable advantage. Frequently, SDK\u00b4s are available in Demo version and include Softphone examples just only to compile.Nowadays, Apple has changed its policy and they do not permit applications to run in background mode, it is expected that Android will do the same.In this framework, we are developing a new APP, which will use VoIP technology and particularly a SDK. First step is to test VoIP technology strength and choice between several SDK options.Therefore, we are looking for a programmer who starting from the VoIP SDK examples, adds \u201cpush notifications\u201d (See Note 1) to the examples and compiles them.As result, awardee will deliver two softphones for each SDK, one for Android and the other one for IOS. Format files will be *.ipa (Iphone) and *.apk (Android).All softphones will be tested (by others) during 2-3 weeks in order to check sound quality, memory and CPU usage, etc. After this test awardee can be required to modify some parameter values in order to comply with quality requirements and finally, to compile again.SDK\u00b4s will be provided by us (two different renowned companies).Main features required for each application will be:-\tMake / receive SIP calls-\tMute Speaker.-\tMute microphone.-\tAudio conference.-\tCaller ID.-\tDND (do not disturb).-\tIM (instant messaging).-\tAES (acoustic echo suppression)-\tDTMF (Dual-tone multi-frequency)-\tAGC (automatic gain controller)-\tNoise suppression.-\tVoice activity detection-\tProtocol SRTP/TLS-\tAdaptive Jitter Compensation.Awardee will check the existing examples adding missing functionalities (if any).Awardee should ensure \u201cPush notifications\u201d are implemented and the softphone availability is around 100%, no register issues can happen. These are the most important things of this job.No files will be uploaded to Google Play Store or Apple Store.At the end, service provider will deliver all files required for compiling. This material will be property of us uniquely.Please, read carefully this document before make an offer and indicate previous experience with VoIP and/or APP development.Note, this is the first task, next one will be to program the hole APP and awardee will be in advantageous position.--------Note 1:IOS:[url removed, login to view]Android:[url removed, login to view]", "skills": ["Android", "iPhone", "Mobile App Development", "VoIP"], "title": "Compile existing Voip Softphone Examples and include Push Notifications"}, {"url": "/projects/mobile-phone/made-ipa-distribute-third-party-14818237/", "desc": "made right ipa from existed  codeupload to the [url removed, login to view] and downloadable.", "skills": ["iPhone", "Mobile App Development"], "title": "made ipa and distribute to third party site"}, {"url": "/projects/mobile-phone/mobile-development-14816449/", "desc": "I need an Android app.  I already have a design for it, I just need it to be built.
