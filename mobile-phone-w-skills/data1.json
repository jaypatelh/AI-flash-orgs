You can declare a layout in XML. Declare UI elements in XML. Android provides a straightforward XML vocabulary that corresponds to the View classes and subclasses, such as those for widgets and layouts.The advantage to declaring your UI in XML is that it enables you to better separate the presentation of your application from the code that controls its behavior. Your UI descriptions are external to your application code, which means that you can modify or adapt it without having to modify your source code and recompile.Android Layout TypesThere is number of Layouts provided by Android which you will use in almost all the Android applications to provide the different view, look and feel.i.\tConstraintLayoutii.\tLinearLayout (Vertical)iii.\tLinearLayout(Horizontal)iv.\tRelativeLayoutv.\tTableLayoutvi.\tGridLayoutvii.\tFrameLayoutWrite the XMLUsing Android's XML vocabulary, you can quickly design UI layouts and the screen elements they contain, in the same way, you create web pages in HTML \u2014 with a series of nested elements. Each layout file must contain exactly one root element, which must be a View or ViewGroup object. Once you've defined the root element, you can add additional layout objects or widgets as child elements to gradually build a View hierarchy that defines your layout.Assignment Description:In this work, you need to write XML codes to demonstrate your understanding of the SEVEN (7) types of layouts. Browse through the Google Play to find your favorite app to redesign the graphic user interface (GUI) with the suitable type of Layout. For each GUI, you need to reference to the original app website address.What do you have to hand in?Project XML Code, a screen print: Provide a single zipped file containing all directories/files in your Android project.

There are three phases in the project.Phase one:The app will have many users, that will have profiles built to give them different type of access to the content of the app. (We will have management, employees and suppliers using the app). They will not be granted the same access in the app, depending on the level of access they are allowed.The app will need a section with a users repertory. Users will be able to search other users by name or by keywords. (Like the job title or functions). Again, if possible, not all users will be granted to see the complete list of the repertory. (That specific thing, I could survive if not possible). When the user is found. The user's phone numbers should be ready to dial in one clic.It would be great to locate our connected users on a map.Need to create a messaging system with different groups with different levels of messaging. (Level one can access all users of any groups, level two some specific groups and on).I need to create a section where some users will create one ore more specific events, that will be transmitted to people of the group or groups the user is programmed to reach. If possible, each of the events should offer the possibility to be updated in real time by any of the reached users.Again, if possible. It would be nice to have a way to notify all the concerned users (Push notifications) as updates are done.In the same section. I would need my users to be able to add some files or pictures to their posts. In real time it could provide very good infos the the rest of the team.All of my requested data needs to be archived and ideally printed by an admin user.Each user has some degree of responsibility. The users responsibilities need to be reached through his profile and also through the event he was notified. (If that is possible).
