User chooses 5 major crypto currency trading exchanges (can be from coinindex or similar place)2. User chooses currency pair for the the 5 exchanges (major currency pairs - can be from coinindex or similar place)3. Each exchange will be a tile on the screen. So a total of 5 tiles.4. Each exchange tile will:- show latest crypto currency balance in BTC and in selected currency pair- show latest bid price- show latest bid price with exchange fees included (i.e. latest bid price plus latest bid price*0.25%)- a buy button next to it for buying instantly- editable field for % buying exchange fees. Default is 0.25%- show latest ask price- show latest ask price with exchange fees included (i.e. latest ask price minus latest ask price*0.25%)- a sell button next to it for selling instantly- editable field for % exchange fees for selling. Default is 0.25%- a button for funds transfer (this is a link to go to the exchange)5. Highlight in a different color the exchange tile and sell price with commission and the exchange tile and lowest buy price with commission. This will be two different exchanges. Move these to be the two tiles. This way, the five exchange tiles can be in three rows 2+2+1.6. All prices will be changing dynamically in realtime7. Below the tiles show a standard price trend line chart of the currency pair selected (with option for choose trend view by the minute, 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, day, week, month, year etc. )8. A second chart below the above chart to show % change in price trend line chart of the currency pair selected (with option for choose trend view by the minute, 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, day, week, month, year etc. )9. App should be deployable on mobile or desktop or cloud.10. App should allow API keys integration with the exchanges for each of the tile informationTesting of 5-10 trades on each of the exchange, and check on links and charts will be considered successful and complete.This is just phase 1.
