Most subjects have many chapters, and the subjects have to take a quiz at the end of each chapter.Each quiz has 100 questions.We will need a progress bar on our website to control the average of each subject that the student has accomplished so far; before he answers all the answer completely. Besides, the status of the progress bar must be saved somewhere if the student doesn\u2019t have chance to answer all the questions for the subject that he has chosen.  The status of progress bar must be saved before the user signing out. Once the user signs in back the system must send him automatically back where he was while he was answering to the question before signing out.@ Cant work if offline too.", "skills": ["Android", "Mobile App Development"], "title": "Education Quiz Apps", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/education-quiz-apps/"}, {"desc": "I am a medical student passionate about public health and pursuing a career in Global Surgery with a focus on low and middle income countries like Cameroon, my home country. One issue which exists in low and middle income countries is the fact that when a patient goes to a clinic one month and then goes to another provider another month, it becomes really difficult to know what care the patient has received. Sometimes, illiteracy and language barriers further complicate this problem.My solution to this is to create an app and/or a credit card which can be swiped by the healthcare provider to look at the patient's files. I am thinking of it in the way that Square cash and card readers which can be plugged into phones have worked. I also think it would be helpful to be able to have this information registered in some sort of database which can be accessed by providers to keep track of their patients and monitor trends or patterns.", "skills": ["Database Programming", "Mobile App Development", "Programming", "Website Management"], "title": "Design an app for healthcare information storage", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/design-app-for-healthcare-information/"}, {"desc": "I need an iPhone/iPad app. I would like it designed and built.", "skills": ["iPad", "iPhone", "Mobile App Development"], "title": "Best phone", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/best-phone/"}, {"desc": "Hello - I am in need to build a beta/demo version of an iOS application I have already designed.
