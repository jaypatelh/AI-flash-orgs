Registration and AuthenticationUber like apps should offer social media and email/password signup and login functionality. Creating a profile, beyond improving customer retention, is required for services that involve mobile payments. As an additional requirement for drivers, profiles should be verified and approved by the service administration.2. Profile editingPassengers and drivers should be able to easily edit their own profiles: name, photo, phone number, email, etc. The driver app should also include the driver\u2019s license and information about the vehicle (manufacturer and year of production, car class, color, license plate number) and its photo. Both the driver and the passenger should be able to view each other\u2019s profile. With this information, they can recognize each other at the pickup location. This helps reduce anxiety and gives a sense of security.3. MatchingMatching allows a passenger to automatically connect to the nearest available driver. It\u2019s a complex algorithm which takes into account several factors: locations of the passenger and nearby drivers (Uber shows up to 8 drivers), drivers\u2019 status and their rating, car models, etc. The driver has a few seconds to accept the request (Uber gives 15 seconds) before it goes to the next driver.4. NavigationAt the heart of a location-based app like Uber is the technology of GPS tracking, around which everything else is built on. It allows to identify current locations of passengers and drivers, draw paths between them, set pickup and drop-off locations, track the movement of cars and even calculate the cost of the ride and the ETA (estimated time of arrival). All these data sets are sent to the server for further processing and broadcasting to other users in that particular area.5. NotificationsUse Firebase Cloud Messaging for Android6. Evaluating and displaying the cost of a rideBoth the driver and the passenger should know the estimated fare in advance. As we mentioned earlier, calculating the actual fare of the trip is usually performed on the server-side. It may involve the following parameters and factors: the distance between pickup and drop-off locations, cost of fuel, possible discounts, car class, traffic and weather conditions, peak hours etc.7. Making paymentsThis is how it works within Uber\u2019s app:Uber has partnered with Braintree to securely accept payments within the app. All payments are cashless, so when the ride has completed, payment is withdrawn automatically through the payment gateway.You have to choose PayU Money Payment Integration. We will provide you with the required help for payment integration.8. Rating and feedbackPassengers and drivers should be able to rate each other after the trip is over. This feature helps maintain a high level of service. Drivers with low ratings will eventually not be able to use the service. If a passenger has a low rating, it can be harder for him to get a ride. Passengers should also be able to provide feedback on their experience during the trip. This feedback will be shown in the driver\u2019s profile for others to view.9. Booking and payments historyBoth drivers and passengers should be able to view detailed statistics about previous trips from their profiles: date, time, cost, driver/passenger name, car model, pickup and drop-off locations, rating etc.10. Booking cancellationDrivers and passengers should be able to cancel a ride. In the case of a cancellation, a fee may be charged.Admin panelThe admin panel is usually a web-based interface that helps manage the entire service: manage back-end settings, manage drivers, passengers, requests, transactions, view passengers and drivers\u2019 activities, statistics, and generate reports.", "skills": ["Android", "MySQL", "node.js", "PHP", "RESTful"], "title": "Taxi Booking App like Uber (Android Project)"}, {"url": "/projects/mobile-phone/mobile-development-15455882/", "desc": "I need an Android app.  I already have a design for it, I just need it to be built.
