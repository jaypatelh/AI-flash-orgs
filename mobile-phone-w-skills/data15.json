(Battery Status, Anti-theft device control in remote, vehicle remote lock facility so that we can lock and shut down the vehicle if the User does not pay).Electric Scooters are assembled by a Gujarat Based Supplier.We would also like to know/track all the available digital data from vehicle dash-board.We are a new startup and we are aiming to provide \"electric mobility services\" (Mobile App Only Service) to lower income group people having 10,000/-Rs to 40,000/-Rs monthly income and who have daily travel of more than 30 kilometers (in their job profile) and at present who are daily travelling 30 KM or more through a Petrol 2 Wheeler (either scooter or motorcycle).Our Electric Vehicle actual cost is between 50,000/-Rs to 55,000/-Rs, But through our proposed website & Mobile App, this electric vehicle will be available in just 6,000/-Rs only to the Users/Customers through a predetermined business process/strategy. There is a set methodology to do this! We use \"Credit Worthiness\" of the User & pursue an NBFC (non banking finance company, vehicle finance company) or banks to get 75% to 100% Finance for the Vehicle. This way, capital investment is getting reduced.The Electric Vehicle (Scooter & Motorcycle) has top speed of 48 KMPH, Range - 80 KM in 1 time Charge of Battery, Battery consumes 2 Units of Electricity, It takes 4 to 5 hours to charge the battery 100%.

We expect 1 Lac Clean Kilometers Traders in 1st Year and 5 Lac in Second Year, So, You will earn 10 Lac Rs in First Year and 50 Lac Rs in Second Year.This might become total 7 Lac Rs to 62 Lac Rs Project Order.The website and App is required to collect payment of 2/-Rs Per Kilometer Driven By Each Vehicle.
