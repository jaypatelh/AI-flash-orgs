It also used [url removed, login to view] to manage sending the notifications, but we now have more users than our UrbanAirship free account allows. So we would now like to use a custom solution.We will develop the server-side code ourselves. This will work using PHP on our web server. We will build a web-based user interface to send the notifications to Apple's Push Notification Service (APNS).We need an iOS developer for the client side code, so that push notifications can be received on iOS devices from the APNS. When a notification is received, it should carry the headline of the news article, and tapping the headline should open our app at the relevant news page.FURTHER DETAILSIf you wish to see all the code for the existing iOS app, please send me your GitHub username and I will grant you access to our repository there.You will probably have further questions about this project, so please don't hesitate to ask.
