When your washing machine breaks down you take a look on google and research the closest plumber, call them to book an appointment and wait. The idea of this app is to show live, available traders near you to avoid this researching and waiting period. You see a plumber who is available on the app, you select them and they either accept or reject your request. Once the job is finished both parties will leave a review - mainly benefiting the service provided from the trader. The payment is based only on a \"call out\" fee relating to a fixed call out fee and distance required to travel. meaning that the actual price of the job will be discussed between the customer and the trader. The app would ideally begin with 3 main trades but looking to increase the amount of options based on the success of the app. Some examples are listed below;ElectricianGas, Heating & PlumbingRoofingPainting/DecoratingBricklayingWindow CleaningGardenerMechanicHairdressingThe app will be popular in both towns and cities where population is greater therefore the app is used by more people but also in smaller countryside villages where services are less readily available and the need for certain trades would prove easier to find if the app were to be used. It is designed to be simple and fast to use.There are many apps that show different traders, the locations of the traders along with telephone numbers/email addresses to book an appointment. However, there is nothing that provides such an easy, convenient and live service that cuts out the time consuming research and provides a readily available service for the customer.Preferably I would like someone who is in Europe and available to meet me in person, to see my ideas and discuss face to face.Project ID: 15108876", "skills": ["App Developer", "Google Maps API", "Reviews"], "title": "Build an app"}, {"url": "/projects/mobile-phone/hypergolf-igaming/", "desc": "I am looking for a complete turnkey solution for the igaming, gambling website/APP , with franchised licensing, in Casino, igames, with different games software connected, money management, Software should be to have a complete solution for the back office, customer services, marketing campaign.it should get easy connection with the existing casino with licenses.", "skills": ["App Designer", "App Developer", "Game Development", "iPhone", "Mobile App Development"], "title": "HYPERGOLF IGAMING"}, {"url": "/projects/app-developer/hire-app-developer-15199357/", "desc": "We would like to make a native app for our project Talking statues in New YorkIt should be very basic and include:- GPS geo location finder- Build in HTML code to activate talking statues (see below how it works***)- QR reader- Generel contact info- GEO Fence \u2013 Auto Push- Push messages- Social media integration- Sponsorpage- List of statuesBbackground on each statue (when was it made, why, by whom etc.)Works on Google play and IphoneInfo for development.Please view our homepage and background of the project.[url removed, login to view]Map for the statues[url removed, login to view]How it works - you scan a statue and it will call you up**** [url removed, login to view]", "skills": ["App Developer"], "title": "Hire an App Developer"}, {"url": "/projects/mobile-phone/mobile-development-15199341/", "desc": "I need  an iPhone app.  I already have a design for it, I just need it to be built.
