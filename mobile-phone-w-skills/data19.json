I want design more cute and smaller. Like it:2.\tHere you can see new menu item \"Llamar\" (link to call to phone watch number -user setted on registration page, see on Task 11-) Will be simply item with link: <a href=\"tel:xxxxxxxxx\">Llamar</a>Add another menu items (Configurar (and into it, some of other items, and a new item \"Tel\u00e9fonos SOS\" that permits to go to a page to introduce the phone numbers:3.\tIf you touch \"Hist\u00f3rico\" then you put Interval between 2 dates, and it shows you positions between these 2 dates. But i preffer to add time too. It is date and time (sometimes user want to know positions on the last 5 hours, for example)4.\tOn same Hist\u00f3rico option. when loads all positions, if there are many points, the load is very low. Then better don't load all points between the 2 datetimes. Better do it:Only show 100 points. It is, if between 2 dates we have 200 positions, then only show one of each 2 positions: position 1, position 3, position 5, position7..... If there are 400 positions, then, take every one of each 4 positions. If 1500 positions, then divide 1500/100 = 15. It is, postition 1, position 15, position 30, position 45....If division is not integer, for example: 120 positions will be 120/100= 1.2 then we can round the results, so can be:120/100, each 1.2 positions:1.2 =position 1 (rounding 1.2)2.4 = position 2 (rounding 2.4)3.6 = position 44.8 = position 56.0 = position 67.2 = position 78.4 = position 8etc...5.\tI need on historic, to be possible to see the order of positions to know the movement of person. It is: from where to where?.It is, reproduce movement of person. For example, every 1 second, show a different point colored on red, on same order than positionsOn moment 0:35 of this video, you can see that label of Google maps is moving (well, hiding of a point and appearing on next point) Is possible to do it?If is not possible, then, put number of position on each point (1, 2, 3, 4, 5\u2026.) and on click on each point, show datetime and link to position6.\tWhen you touch any menu element, menu remains outspread. I preffer to compact menu after choose an option.7.\tNow, you can see the menu on bottom and header on top with info about last watch update and battery. If possible, i prefer this info on same compacted menu (if possible). For example, on same header, on the left side, show the menu button, and spread on touch:Or perhaps put info of watch update and battery on same menu bar text (Instead actual text \"Synkiria Watch\")8.\tWhen you touch command \"Buscar\", the position of watch appears on map, but map don't center on point.

The $100 USD is for 4.A, 10.B & 13.M8 - If time permits this would be another great screen to setup as it has a few controls as well as some animation that would take place when a user mouses over a particular rating. The idea is when you mouse over the 2nd screen the text related to 2 stars would be shown. For now, just make the text say something like \u201cTwo stars\u201d, then change it to \u201cThree stars\u201d when the user mouses over 3 stars.Again, it\u2019s very critical this doesn\u2019t look cookie cutter and everything looks pixels perfect (our assumption is that\u2019s possible based on the designs), so please take your time and make sure these test slides are as perfect as possible.", "skills": ["Graphic Design", "iPhone", "Mobile App Development", "Objective C", "Swift"], "title": "Several iOS screen development", "url": "/projects/graphic-design/several-ios-screen-development/"}, {"desc": "Im just an appreneur that is trying to solve the parking problem in my country..
