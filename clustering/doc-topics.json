various programs and Apps for engaging with the users The Apps by the company are most download engineering apps in the worldTwo minds connect and partners with various companies and colleges in the education space providing the education material to the students It also has a forum which hosts primarily user generated content Millions of users visit the platform every year to download read and interact with fellow users on the contentThe company has stepped into app utility space and would like to develop a mobile app which would help fight depression in the society Depression is not caused by a sudden sickness but caused by facing continuous difficulties over a period of time These difficulties may include work stress anxieties troubles in personal life etc Like for many other illnesses health professionals believe that if depression is treated while it is in the early stage it would be more impactful However many times it is too late for people to realise that they are suffering from depression Sometimes it gets difficult for family and friends to provide support to people suffering as many does not disclose their medical condition thinking not to bother others The company would like to develop an app which would pick the signs of depression at an early stage and take assistive measuresProject requirementsApplication SetupUpon installation the app should record essential details from the user such as name gender time to bed and next of kin These details will be stored locally and user should be allowed to update them at a later stageRate your dayEvery day the app should remind the user to rate their day at the time recorded for \u2018time to bed\u2019 The rating would be either excellent good average or bad These ratings must be stored in a local database for analysis purpose The reminder to rate your day can be snoozed if the user is busy during that timeAnalyticsAnalyse the data collected from the user and present a summary of how user\u2019s life is progressing The analysis can be compared on weekly monthly and yearly basis The analysis will help user predict the symptoms of depression at an early stage The summary and comparison of the analysis must be shown in a graphical formatThe project team should refer to these applications to get some idea about showing analytics \u2013 Sleep Cycle WaterMinder and SevenNotificationsIf a user rates five or more days as \u2018bad\u2019 in a row the application should notify the next of kin listed in the app The aim of this feature is to ensure that family and friends of the user are notified that heshe is feeling low so that they can provide some sort of supportAndroid Wear SupportOne of the challenge of this app is that users may not regularly rate their day To maximize user inputs the project team should develop a feature where those users using smart watches are notified to rate their day through watch The users should be allowed to rate their day through smart watch app This data should then be synced with Android mobile app for analysisDesign the UI with a modern and minimalist look with no more than 5 colours used The project team is required to build an Android mobile app and Android Wear watch app to facilitate the user input", "topic": "2"}, "2827": {"title": "Develop Drag and Drop HTML Editor For ActiveCampaign Newsletter

Urbancoms Limited manage the whole of our phone systems in our offices they also manage the phone systems at those blocks of flats where we have porters phones lift emergency phones and so forthWe have been working with Urbancoms now for probably something like 10 years During the whole of that period we have received good service when there is a fault it is rectified promptly their technicians have the skills necessary to improve and rectify systems when we need that and there have always been cost savings when we have transferred a new contract to themRichard Nubel AIRPM  Knight Frank LLP  June 2016Since we started using Urbancoms our lives have been so much easier if there are problems with any BT lines We have started transferring a lot more of our blocks over because of the efficiencyThe biggest plus for us is when you call Urbancoms you get an answer straight away and not an automated service that ends up putting you to the wrong department where you end up speaking to someone that doesn\u2019t understand the issueThe first time I used them was because a phone line wasn\u2019t working in a lift and normally we would be spending more time on the phone sorting everything out I called Urbancoms explained to a very competent member of staff and within 10 mins it was all dealt with and BT were on site first thing in the morning never ever happened beforeThis company has helped so much that we can concentrate on other important thingsI also know that some of our blocks have raved to the tenants about Urbancoms and how much cheaper they are which is another bonusI would definitely recommend them to do business with any of our sitesLesley Richards  HML Hawksworth  June 2016", "topic": "4"}, "563": {"title": "Mobile development", "desc": "I need  an iPhone

ours so long as I find the superstar righthand man or woman who can run the team and assist me with client questions and presentationAlright guys and gals my client runs a popular cloud crypto mining website and is looking to branch out into a standalone desktop console and GUI miner with the possibility of some mobile variation dependant on a further feasibility investigation   The desktop miner which links to the site much like NiceHash or Minersgate will need to be able to handle both AMD and NVidia graphical processors as well as a broad range of CPUs in leveraging hashing power from the common home desktop and laptop machines Support for GPU farms and rigs is desired as well  The clients current site offers live cloud mining hash rental and the exchange of around 20 cryptos currencies on 4 or 5 different algorithms  They run mining farms in different areas of the globe to facilitate this business and all of the current infrastructures will need to be accommodated in our prospective design  The client would like to start offering inbrowser CPU mining as well  The site is currently running on an aspnet framework and our products will need to seamlessly interact with their current system or be able to at least get along well enough for automation purposes  This will be a big project and I will need the followingA senior fullstack developer who can oversee all of the other hires from a technical and architectural standpoint present creative and original ideas for my approval to take to the client with a budget and time frame  This can and likely will lead to more andor continuous work in the related industry and I would like to find a lead person whom I can rely on for future projects as wellIn addition the Lead will assist me in choosing the remainder of the team  My background is primarily in graphic design and printing however I have an adequate technical knowledge to oversee the business end of things  My lead will be my goto for addressing concerns regarding EVERY aspect of the project and along with myself will interact directly with the client and his team  So my lead will need a broad and strong set of skills with proven experience on large crossplatform projects  UI and UX personpeople and graphic designer  Backend net and C people preference is given to those with reverse engineering experience  CUDA andor Open CL experts  Full stack webmobile pro or twoAlso any other position the lead convinces me we needI do not have a set budget as of this moment however the client is doing very well and is expansionminded  As the contractor I will be paid by the client in BTC as they have the majority of their working capital in that form  I will give you your choice of either Fiat or BTC however I am discussing timeline and benchmark bonuses with the client for the team which will be paid in BTCMoving forward from this initial project the client would like a fullservice cryptoexchange built next so this is a good opportunity for those with the correct skill sets who have lots of availability and can potentially be an ongoing member of teams for projects I bid to customersI am looking for my senior project

collecting resources will involve a hunt for whatever materials are neededVaselineSlide matsBath tubTo collect vaseline the user will have to walk to a supermarket using the analogue sticks displayed on either side of the screen and purchase it using coins the ingame currency For the slide mats the user will have to walk to a hardware store and once again purchase the mats with coins As for the bath tub the user will have to walk to Jay\u2019s house and take the bath tub The bath tub will either regenerate in 24 hours or that can be sped up using the premium currency \u201cYouTube Money\u201d \u201cYouTube Money\u201d will be earned slowly and many can be bought via ingame purchasesFor stage 2 once the user has collected the materials needed they will travel to the area this video is shot at In this case the user goes up a mountain and builds the setup at the top This is done with the hit of a button however there will be a timer The first timer will be 30 minutes and will increase with each level The timer can be skipped by using YouTube Money or by watching an ad Each ad watch skips 30 minutesFor stage 3 once the timer has run out the user will then play the level So in this case the user will literally be sliding down a long slip and slide that may last for a minute or longer On the way down they will have to remain on the slide by using the analogue sticks and collect as many coins and the occasional YouTube Money as they can If they fall off the slide they fail If they hit something in their way like a cactus or a hedgehog they fail If they fail they have to keep trying again until they successfully complete the levelSo every level and lets say there will be 20 in the initial launch of the game will go a little something like that There may be a special level where a new environment has to be developed like a haunted level where the user has to escape from a haunted building like Denbigh Asylum url removed login to viewSome other ideas we have been discussing for the gameThe game will feature shattered bones and a damage indicator to heal the user has to travel to the hospital and pay using coinsAfter certain levels where something illegal was performed the user may have an interaction with the police and has to take them on in a fightClues will be left around the map for finding certain resourcesThe game should feature very enticing sound effects bright colours and make every goal reached feel like a special event for example coins flying over the screen and a ding sound when a level is completed All transitions in the game should be fluidCharacters should be able to unlock and perform stunts as you progress through the game Performing stunts on a slip and slide will earn more coins etc You learn more stunts by hitting certain goals when playing a level or can buy them with YouTube MoneyGame should include an offbrand energy drink that sends you crazy  helps you earn 4x pointsspeed for example can only drink 1 per dayWe like the idea of online connection and being able to see others playing the game however would like to know more about the reality of this for example if there are a lot of players in one area and if it would add a significant amount to the project cost  server strainThis is about all we have so far as I said we\u2019re looking to develop these ideas into a reality into a 3D game

hear the story out youll need to use simple logic and math to follow nothing difficultIm a member of a discountdealwebsite kinda like Groupon and they have two marketing tools to gain members and to increase sales They do these by awarding credits to people for1 sharing the website and recruit new members2 sharing a voucher youve bought and stimulating others to buy the same oneSometimes theyll have these campains where you can receive 5 euro onto your account these campaigns always work with a discountvaluecode you have to enter into your account to redeem the code and add the credit to your accountHowever these codes always seem to have the same layout an ar easy to generate yourself ex the value code is something like VALUE1586 and another would be VALUE4963 making it easy to just guess a number between 0000 and 9999 to find a working code Most of the time it only takes me 2 or 3 tries to get a working value codeextra information anything you buy with this 5 euro value needs to be priced over 5 euro You cant buy something of 499 for free probably so they still make a small turnover Also you can only win a 5 euro value code once at least one time per registered accountComming back to the two marketingtools1 You can receive 5 euro of credits if you recruit one person 5 euro goes onto your account when te recruit has made a purchase on the website This with a maximum of 4 recruits or 20 euro2 When a users makes a purchase and shares his purchase on social media he can get the initial value of the purchase refunded in credits when there are 3 people that buy the same thing only when they click trough the shared link that was posted on social mediaIf you put 2 and 2 together youll see that I can do following steps to gain free credit into my account create an account that shares its recruitment link lets call this the MAIN account create 4 new accounts using that recruitment link they wil be worth 5 euros when the have made their first purchase add 5 euro per account by trial and errorTHENbuy an item with the MAIN account that costs 525 So I will need to pay 25ct trough bank tranfer or mobile banking and share my purchasehave the 4 new accounts make the same purchase using the shared link on social media and their 5 euro of credit on their accountThis wil result in me paying 125 for the 25ct that needs to be payed for the MAIN  4 new accounts BUT receiving 20 euro worth of recruitment bonus and an extra 525 euros for the reimbursment of the original purchase  2525 euro on the MAIN accountI use a temporary mail server to generate new email adresses easily so I can generate these fake accountsThe complete process takes about 3045 minutes of my time and I would like to automate this so it goes a lot faster and easier Basically what I do know is production line work repeating a dozen of stepsIm looking for someone who can make a tool where I only need the input the purchase that has to be made the one of 525 in the example and  the tool does the rest exept for the payments", "topic": "2"}, "546": {"title": "BBpress job", "desc": "HelloI need 2 things to be done1 I need a plugin modificationThe plugin url removed login to viewThe

vision systems for a supermarket analog Amazon Go Terms of Reference It is necessary that buyers at the entrance to the store open a mobile application the application generates a QR code for each account the QR code will be a ticket to enter the store Buyers making various purchases all displayed on the mobile application for example if a person takes a product from him displayed in a mobile application what exactly he took if a person changes his mind and put the product back on the shelf he has a minus application in his mobile application That would be full integration of the machine vision the mob application iOS  Android turnstiles at the entrance RFID tags scales payment It is proposed to place turnstiles 3 at the entrance 3 at the exit The customer enters the store making various purchases Products may be to stuff his pockets backpack bag etc And quietly left the store when exiting through the turnstile equip the turnstiles with sensors  scanners that must accurately scan the RFID tags which accurately determine the price of the goods typed Upon withdrawal withdrawals must be made from a bank card Also it is necessary that the overdraft principle work For example if there are not enough funds on the bank card the client can safely exit but the lack of funds will be automatically withdrawn when money is received on the Bank card or care in negative also it should be noted if the person hanging a debt In front of the store the customer can not go into the store ie when opening the applications mobile QR code was not generated the message was issued that the client has a debt in nsum After the exit the customer receives electronic cavitation the UBER taxi principle It will be necessary to think over the input for several people for example if a husband and wife friends parents with children come into the store and also if a group of people have logged in to one account the products they purchase are recorded and displayed in the mobile application of the person under whose account A group of people came in People can go to the store with their products For example with their own bottle of drink I do not think that it will take a lot of work tk1 There will be no RFID tag2 There will not be a product to stand on the shelf Not a fullfledged product bottle floor open pack etc It is also important that the system would recognize thefts for example that adults children could not take candy chocolate fruits vegetables and eat right in the hall and also if Buyers tore off an RFID tag or put products without RFID tags in their pockets candies fruits vegetables The store will be aimed at a paying audience but such cases should not be ruled out In the performance of such actions it is necessary that the Security Council immediately become aware of this action Just do not exclude the various stubs foil etc It is possible to replace the technology of RFID tags with another method more accurate modern Recognition is necessary for products at weights Confectionery products sweets vegetables fruits etc as these products are purchased at the weights In any case these storefronts will be serviced by sales consultants integration with weights or with RFID tags is necessary In addition you will need to buy a printer for RFID tags For example in all supermarkets we weigh products and stick a bar code with the price of a bag It is also important to pay great attention to leaving the store It is necessary that the system does not give errors For example if three different people will go out one by one so that money can not be removed from one person CRM It is also necessary to collect data statistics That we could calculate the average check what in the future could according to this statistics create a strategy to increase the average check Also I would like to add a function when the customer enters the mobile application that displays the previous purchases on the screen and asked the customer would you like to repeat these purchases Showroom 1500 sq M Warehouse 300 sq M It is necessary to register the vehicle preferably stepbystep implementation Timing preferably within 12 months It is necessary to register what equipment is necessary and also in what quantity Ideas other options As well as idea A also be kindly written in the form of a technical specification taking into account

currently active online with about 50000 monthly visitors and thousands of registered users I need it rebuilt on a new mobilefriendly responsive framework and all the users and data from the old mysql database to be moved to the new site Front end is already finished so I just need the backend done and integrated with current front end code I need someone with expertise and determination who can succeed where others have failed and who wont give up until the job is doneHistory It took 7 years and about as many coders each building on top of the last to finally get it done to the point where it was ready for public use Since it went live back in 2010 Ive been trying to get it rebuilt since by then it was already outdated Ive been trying now for more than 7 years to get my site rebuilt without success  Now the original core php framework it was built on is more than 14 years old and Im desperate to find someone who can finally get the rebuild done Ive started over 6 times with 6 different providers who each promised me they could do it but none of whom delivered Every one of them wanted to start over from scratch rather than finish work the previous person left undone First 3 attempts were on a Drupal platform 4th on Wordpress 5th on last version of Laravel 6th on new version of Laravel 6th attempt is with same person who worked on 5th version who said he could finish what another provider started but after a year of working on it then claimed he would be able to get it done a lot faster and better if he could start over again from scratch rather than trying to fix the last guys coding problems So between the last two guys we spent nearly 3 years trying to finish rebuild number 5 and 6 has been a work in progress for about 6 months now However I had the front end built by someone else so the front end is finished and only the backend needs to be done and since current guy already had a big head start he promised he could get the job done very quickly if he was allowed to start over After 6 months with nothing to show I am about to give up hope that he can do it since he has missed every deadline hes given mehimself or that Ive given himBecause I am about to give up on the current work in progress Im just looking to see if there is someone who can finally get the rebuild of my site done As mentioned the front end work is finished But the site is complex and there is a lot of data and thousands of users to be transferred My site is nonprofit and free for everyone and does not bring an income so I dont have deep pockets And I am just one person not a business or a corporation so the costs are coming out of my own savings which are nearly depleted If the site is rebuilt with the additional incomeproducing features I want then it will potentially raise funds in the future and I can then afford to provide ongoing work for whoever I hire if they get the job done But for now I need someone with serious expertise and a great track record who is also affordable and not afraid to tackle a problem that others have been unable to solve", "topic": "6"}, "138": {"title": "Project for Masud R.", "desc": "Hi Masud R I need SEO and Digital marketing

"Mobile development", "desc": "I need an Android app  I would like it designed and built  Dear SirMadamI am emailing you regarding an application that me and my team are looking to have developed professionallyOur app idea uses an NFC reader connected to a shops EPOS till via usb which could be used to transmit receipts onto the customers phone rather than them receiving a physical copy of it So once the customer touches their NFC enabled device onto the reader the receipt is stored on the app The app should be able to detect the store that this receipt was given at and sort the receipts by store and by date of purchaseThe app should also have knowledge of each stores returns policy and give notifications when this is due to expire For example if store X would allow you to return the goods within 14 days the app would give you notification running up to this to warn you how many days are left There should also be the stores returns policy in that section We can provide the return policies and timesWe would like to know the technical viability of this We are trying to replace the conventional receipt printer which is connected to the EPOS till by a NFC reader which instead of printing it will put a digital copy on the phoneI have linked below details of the USB NFC reader and have also linked a copy of the SDK Please click on the link to access these url removed login to viewPlease inform me if this link does not workWe can provide this reader for testing if necessaryWe would also like to know a cost be it approximate or accurate of the whole projectWe would also like to know whether this would also require some extra software alongside the NFC reader connected to the EPOS till to workAlso how would this work with different EPOS version tills can we make a universal program or one program for each type of EPOS tillWe would also like to know if this will be available on iphone as well as android with the recent news that apple has introduced NFC capabilities into the iPhone 7 and above and introduced the core NFC framework More is explained at this page url removed login to viewLooking forward to hear from you soon", "topic": "1"}, "2335":

between any two variables of Variables view sectionTo have a better understanding of what the current GUI looks like and the data contained in each section please find the video attached at dropbox linkThe current GUI is just fine for large screens Tablets Laptops etc but the problem is when it is run on a small screen mobile phones with screen sizes as small as 43 because everything is too small to be read clearly etc etcSo I want the freelancer to redesign the GUI of the app for me considering the following major points1 In the current GUI All sections are always visible to the user at all times But this is NOT necessary Only the Video view is the one that is needed at all times So the freelancer could use hideunhide buttons or tabs or whatever is suitable for the other sections Control Variables view Graph2 The buttons in the current GUI have been grabbed from different sources so they do not give the same feel He will also design the buttons that give different feel than

music playlistNumber 3 after the selection by the users that text to speech feature will enable the text into speech so that the user can listen to those topics in detailsNumber 4 there will be a

and ISO what has a website on the backend The app will be mostly like the current application RollKoll you can find on the Google Play Store This is what will be different While you are assigned to an active job there are typically 3 tabs in the job Job Details Tasks and NotesPhotos I would like the Tasks tab moved to the end and changes to Live Chat I would like the chat to be a chat room style setup where all the officers in the same job at the same time to be able to post When they post the other phones will ding to notify them of a message so they can communicate while on the job The NotesPhotos will stay if the same job number is issued again for a new date and time but the chat will not be visible for the next shift I would like a 4th tab added that allows the officers to take a picture upload it and send it to a email the coordinator puts in on the website This will have a sent and received update on it so that the user will know that the email went through Also on the main page where it displays jobs I wont set up differently This app is designed for one organization to run and post all their jobs I want to be able to go on the website as an administrator and input coordinators without admin rights The coordinators will have their own logins where they can look up a app user by phone number or email and add them to their rooster They can input their jobs and assign their own unique job number to the job and how many officers are needed They will see who requests the job and they can decide who they want and add them to the job and it will send a notification that they got the job or was denied The coordinator will also be able to log in and few everyones job details on what they worked so they can pay them using what every process they have independent from the app I want the coordinator to be able to upload a tile and business name that shows on that main app page when the job comes up with the rest of the info on it under that similar to how RollKoll does it Users can be assigned to multiple groups but they can not request the groups themselves They can only download the app and enter their information The coordinator has to add them similar to how the Group Me app works Users will only see jobs in groups they have been added too On the website I want the administrator to be able to assign how many users each coordinator can allow 20 or less 50 or less 100 or more Also in the user profile I want them to not only have a profile picture that is associated with things they note or chat but I would like an upload section where they take a front and back photo of their department ID Basically this app would be mostly like RollKoll but able to be personalized by the coordinators similar to Group Me and a chat function

create an iOS application where players are able to play against each other in a multiplayer platform in Rock Paper Scissors online with CASH prizesImportant This is not going to be a gambling application Users will not have to risk anything of value as the game is 100 free to enter with the chance of winning the CASH prizes through skill rather than luck The most important aspect of this application is that it runs smoothly without any lag as well as ensuring users that this is a SAFE FREE NONGAMBLING APPLICATION where they can win PRIZE MONEYConcept tournament This would be a multiplayer game with a game format similar to Wimbledon Tennis Knockout Tournament This will be a tournament of best of 3 Sets 1 set will be awarded to the player who first reaches 3 wins against their opponent If it is 11 1 set each the first player to win the next set will eliminate their opponent When you win you advance and play the next opponent until you reach the last opponent standing Winner has prize money of X deposited into their Paypal account or can take the money in virtual in game currency to put towards in game features such as skins etcIMPORTANT The tournament initially will be once a day 5 days a week subject to change at a specific time However the tournament will only commence once a certain number of players enter the tournament Once the desired number is reached the tournament will commence no one will be able to enter the tournament once it has begunConcept free play We want this game to also be available to be played outside that of the tournaments every day We want users to be able to still play others online where there will be challenges to complete and virtual coins to obtain When players complete challenges they have a chance of winning 1 treasure box token or virtual coins Also play the computer if possibleConcept artworkWe are happy to provide some sketches for how we would like the application to look The first screen will be where people sign up and create accounts which stores their username and saves their Paypal email ID in case they win the tournament Users must be explained thoroughly that this is free and their Paypal ID will only be used to deposit the Cash prizes if they win a tournament The USER must feel that this application is SAFEWe want the games to be played in arenas where there is a table in the middle where there will be two HANDS on either side of the table We want the Hand to be able to perform the function of Scissors Rock Clinched hand Paper Flat handMonetisationinapp ideas IOS Ads in app at bottom or top ads similar to clash of clans and other such apps etc Video adds to watch to obtain virtual coins In app purchases for skins We want Users to be able to purchase virtual coins to obtain enough coins to buy Skins for their hand which can be showcased online against other opponents We also want their to be a treasure box that will cost a certain amount of coins still obtainable through

this Project which address the below vision and speak directly to our brand the MMA fighting industry and our overall vision will be assessedWe are seeking an extremely talented individual or team of web developers AND graphic designers to take a template Shopify Theme Parralax Aspen theme url removed login to view and turn it into a beautiful multifaceted website for a Mixed Martial Arts clothing brandThe brand itself has been in existence for the better part of 5 years now and has a loyal consumer base which have been developed through an incredibly strong social media presence We are now seeking to try and monetise this customer base of more than 30000 active followers  users et cetera by driving our engaged social media audience to our website to purchase our clothing linesThe existing brand and website can be found at wwwbowfighterscomau With a unique focus on Mixed Martial Arts MMA the site we are looking for needs to have powerful and incredibly crisp imagery simplicity and of course a brilliant customer experience so they are able to purchase our clothes with incredible easeFunctionality  refer to url removed login to view before reading belowThe high level technical requirements of the first phase of our website are therefore as follows1       Implementation of full Google Analytics Suite  Facebook Analytics and further search engine optimisation for the Bow Store2       Redesign of Product Page to provide a cleaner UX when making a purchase decision3       Complete redesign of the Advocates page4       Inclusive Blog  Vlog system5       Implementation of responsive website to ensure that we can support mobile traffic and general CSS  website styling improvements throughout the remainder of the site6       Implementation of Affiliate Marketing System7       Implementation of MailChimp Automated Marketing SystemThese issues are expanded upon in much more detail in the attachment which must be reviewedUser Interface  User Experience  refer to url removed login to viewIn order to provide a high level functionality overview we have developed a Bow website based on what the new website can do or where I think the brand has massive potential and what it should be focusing uponNote that the design and layout of this website is horrible and is not to be used as inspiration We require significant graphic designer input here to create a beautiful user interface for the website users which will include all photo layout and choices We can provide some template photos for use however there will also be a requirement that the graphic designer source additional photos for specific pages if there is nothing that we have as a collateral that fits the use caseThe overall outcome is that these new website users will constantly be exposed to \u2018Bow Products\u2019 and if the training and blogs are good they will want to associate themselves with the grand and therefore will hopefully be more likely to buy more Bow ProductsThe website above is only a prototype and again is not to be used as the foundation for aesthetic design  layout etc It is solely for the functionality side of things NB there is still a bit of dummy data in there which can be ignored but you will get the gistWe look forward to discussing our website requirements in more detail in the near futureThanksBow Fighters", "topic": "4"}, "819":

we send a code to our customer They can enter in a website and with that code check if the study is ready If it is they can download it The project is about to create a mobile app to do the sameSo we need an Ionic app with just a screen where user can enter that codeIt will call a PHP backend also to be develop as part of this project which will look for the study at certain path lets say studiescodepdfIf it is there then sends it to the app and this last one has to show it in another screen not opening an external appBut if the study is not yet ready file doesnt exists has to inform the user and as soon and the file is copied to the path send a notification to the app informing study is now availableWhen the app is opened again having saved the previous code has to call to the backend again which now will return the study and will show itThinks to keep in mind1 Backend has to be develop as part of this project It has to be in PHP 53 working with a MySQL database Server runs linux2 Studies are upload via ftp to a folder in the same server where the backend is running It has to detect when a study is uploaded automatically using iNotify and then notify the app via push notifications3 We want to use Ionic Services for the push notification service App ideally should be make with Ionic but is not mandatory4 In any case the app has to run in Android iOS and Windows 10 mobileSo what we expect to receive in order to consider the project fullfilled and what would be our test cases1 We recieve a Code of hybrid app with the functionalities mentioned b PHP code for the backend we need to make everything to work c File with the needed scripts to create the tables in a MySql db that the backed needsWhat would we do to check everything is ok1 Create a mysql database and run scripts provided2 Copy PHP to an Apache site3 Take the code modify the backend URL so it points to our test site and deploy to an android device4 Will copy a file url removed login to view to a folder inside the backed in the path the backend is checking for the studies5 Will write the code 1234 in the android app It has to call the backend and then since the file is there has to download it and show to me inside an app screen6 Will close the app Open it again and write the code 56787 The app will check the backend wont find the file so will alert me that the file havent yet been uploaded8 I will copy a file url removed login to view to the backend9 The backend has to realize by itself that the file was uploaded so will send a push notification to my phone10 I will receive a notification in my phone I will open the app again It has to remember the last code I wrote so as soon as it opens will check the server again for the study Now the backned has to return a file and the open and show me as it did in point 5These steps are the one required to consider the project as completedTo send and receive notifications you can create your own account in Ionic Services page or we can create it and send you the credentials note that to send notification in android you need to create a project in Googles ConsoleAlso as additional note you can create if you wish the app in iOS Our test will be done in Android anyway but everything should run fine despite of it", "topic": "1"}, "2238": {"title": "I would like to hire a Videographer", "desc": "HiI\u2019m a recent college
