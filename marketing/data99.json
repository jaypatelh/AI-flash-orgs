I require knowledgeable experience in marketing / successful tricks of the trade to fit my desired vision  as below :My creative process is one of enjoying the process so i undertake far too many themes / media / and get easily distracted by trying to overdo every artwork , especially commissions . Social presences on MOST art / prints / social sites with little more than likes to show has me needing to rethink my campaign. Due to my own non successes i have learnt alot myself , and DO NOT expect an expert \"outsourced\" management entity... Real , preferably brutal know how with PROVEN stats / experience is needed / successful artist BRANDING is needed.NOTE im nowhere near a stereotypical \" artist \" , i have however impressed very affluent established local artists with my rebellious style in art as well as presentation. NOR do i want to be a typical quiet career artist - I enjoy social entrepreneurship and enabling ANYONE through sharing / trying to assist them being the best they can and do well ( hopefully pay it forwardConsider me a horribly interested in everything but yet to successfully make one work well type of guy. I stay in south africa and besides general africa trust issues , Huge costs of Shipping and a general stagnant scene has me looking towards Art prints ( in relative countries ) as a start. Honestly only now do i produce art serious enough to be considered ( general a1 size painting costs thousands to ship ,more than the actual artwork)I do however note that on all the different platforms , different things work etc. It seems however MOSTLY based on the marketing. Art is a weird game of self seeking and self control.I do not require \" what sites are best for abc  , share your personal side , establish a relationship with consumers ... i already have following  .. . . each seems to have its own strategy. And cannot afford it either. Literally looking for a creative \" friends with benefits ( social accrual in art / products / community upliftment ) even to just notice my insane level of determination to have my stories seen and help others . Media contacts, kind soul with following that can relate to my almost - dying ruthless yearning to make it work. I write better than i paint and my words and messages are the real crux , and i am very self taught and dont even know what a studied \"artist\" is or isnt supposed to do. Im young and full of fire and believe in this huge internet world passion through persecution resonates more than just \"wanting to do something\" My life is literally precariously hoping as my personal story doesnt have me an ignorant wannabe... ill die for this... ( and kill) tongue in cheek . Some guy jesus has me convincedFind attached some work just for sharing if not interested , if anything calls to you and feel inclined even correct me on price etc or whatever ( even naysay) . Huge heart no more faiths to give . Note MANY are for animal charity and homeless kids , so sometimes \" rushed \". Id let go of a 10 000 painting for a loaf of bread if need be . Simple info can hel , but if something is worth it i will continue paid services and more expectation. Everybody just wants a fair chance, i have no idea what this is worth so ye.
