Gross I run Course Concierge, an online course production company that creates done-for-you video courses for NYT best-selling authors, TED speakers and subject-matter experts from numerous domains.We\u2019ve built this company on the success of Till\u2019s first company (see his TEDx talk with 2M views here [url removed, login to view] or hear Tim Ferriss rave about his work here [url removed, login to view] ) and lessons I\u2019ve learned helping a renowned speaker launch an instant NYT bestseller, create a YouTube channel with 100,000,000 views and produce more than seven online products.Course Concierge has been a rapid success and we are expanding our team and looking for a young hot-shot copywriter/direct-response marketer who\u2019s ready to prove himself/herself.For the right person, this is a Dream Job \u2013 and dream company.If you\u2019re someone who\u2026- Is dying to become a master marketer or copywriting virtuoso- Wants to work with the top people in various industries- Loves investigate research, understanding customers\u2019 motivations, their pains and fears, and their hopes and dreams- Dreams insanely big and wants to live an extraordinary life- Gets excited by email open rates over 30% and dreams about lower CPAs- Is a terrific writer and questioner- Gets excited at the prospect of learning a tremendous amount, with fast-paced and varied demands- Is supremely well organised, a self-starter and very capable- Has an extreme drive to success and doesn\u2019t stop until you\u2019ve won- Wants to connect with powerful and successful people and build an insane network...This could be the opportunity you've been looking for.We\u2019re a great company to join. Here\u2019s why\u2026- Course Concierge was founded less than a year ago, but already we\u2019ve been tremendously successful. You will be coming in at ground level, and we put a huge emphasis on \u2018homegrown\u2019 talent. This means as long as you\u2019re proactive there are NO LIMITS to how far you can grow in this role.- We have an unbelievably engaged team, with world-class people in every department (from video production to design to editorial).- Our clients are fantastic. We only take on a handful and are incredibly selective in who we work with. Our clients include NYT best-selling authors, TED Speakers, FBI advisers, Stanford professors, NFL coaches and YouTubers with hundreds of millions of views.- Integrity and honesty are our battle cry. Our clients come to us trusting that we understand that their reputation is more important than short-term revenue from the next launch.- You will get to work side-by-side with our CEO and learn a tremendous amount (and rub elbows with A-list celebrities and mingle with successful entrepreneurs).Your ResponsibilitiesYou will have three main responsibilites that blend into each other \u2013 all various facets of online marketing.1. Customer ResearchIn My Life In Advertising, Claude Hopkins wrote, \u201cOne of the greatest advertising men this country has developed [...] spent weeks in going from farm to farm to learn the farmers\u2019 viewpoint. I have known him to ring a thousand doorbells to gain the [customer]'s angle.\u201dIf there\u2019s one thing that is the foundation to become a great marketer, it\u2019s understanding the customer's hopes and dreams as well as their pains and fears.We will teach you this!In the way that career progression at JP Morgan starts with being an analyst, our customer research will be a key part of your first months at Course Concierge.You\u2019ll learn our proprietary customer research process that allows us to elicit holes in the market and drill down to what customers really want. It\u2019s customers that put Course Concierge on the map in the shortest time possible. It\u2019s part of our secret sauce and you\u2019ll be the one to lead it.2. CopywritingWe live and breath copywriting. There\u2019s no week in which we don\u2019t throw around an Ogilvy quote or ponder an excerpt from Scientific Advertising. Our copy chief is one of the most accomplished copywriters around and there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve read her words. For years she wrote for the likes of Ramit Sethi, Ryan Levesque and Paul Walker (to name just a few).You'll learn how to write hard-hitting copy and get more real world-experience that you could get anywhere else. You\u2019ll be thrown in at the deep end and get to write landing pages, craft social media posts, assemble Facebook ads, and write entire email series that are seen by millions.And you\u2019ll write A LOT.3. Marketing ExecutionSetting up landing pages, coming up with split-tests, brainstorming promo videos, managing Facebook ads.You\u2019ll be in the weeds of online marketing and get to execute massive campaigns. Instead of hoping to get a few more visitors on a blog a day, you\u2019ll get to drive thousands of sales, build email lists with hundreds thousands of people, and assemble launches viewed by millions.It\u2019s in your hands!People that have worked in a similar way with Till in the past have made massive jumps in their career. For example, Joe, who after 1.5 years of working with Till became the head of marketing at a venture-backed startup and even made it into the founders\u2019 team.The key is initiative. We are moving insanely fast and we want you so we can move and execute even faster. For this reason we NEED someone who doesn\u2019t wait to be told what to do. To get the most out of this role, you need to be proactive. Think there\u2019s a great angle to market a product? Great. You\u2019ll be the one to lead it.We believe in deliberate practice and deep work, to build tremendous amounts of \u201ccareer capital\u201d. We will have plenty to supply.SpecificsWe want someone who\u2019s ready to hustle and work their ass off in-person together with Till. This means you either need to be based in Los Angeles or ready to relocate within the next month.You need to be a native English speaker. This will be a full-time position. Working hours will be long and hard. However, once in awhile they will be spiced up with a dinner in the Hollywood hills, a celebrity house party or a mid-day yoga session with a new potential client. Till loves bringing people around and it will be great way for you to build an incredible network.To apply...Send Till and I a pitch to recruiting@[url removed, login to view] on why you think you would be a great fit for the role, and confirm that you are either living in Los Angeles or ready (and able) to relocate.Please do not send a resume, CV or attachment of any kind. We don\u2019t care where you went to college (or that you even went at all)\u200a\u2014\u200aall that matters is whether you can do it. (To quote Claude Hopkins: I know nothing of value which an advertising man can be taught in college. I know of many things taught there which he will need to unlearn before he can steer any practical course.)Our deadline for submissions is Sunday October 1st, though those who apply sooner have an advantage.For those who stand out, we will set a small copywriting/marketing test and then set up a Zoom call to discuss the role further.We hope to find someone we will be working with for many years.Thank you for reading.
