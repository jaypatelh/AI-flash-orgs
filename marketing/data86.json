Basically it is an ecommerce website. I would like to hire someone, who knows how to bring sales, whichever way possible. There is no fixed budget for this, because job is commission based. i am ready to pay 10% of what the store makes regularly, to a prospective candidate who can keep marketing and selling. So, if you take this job, You agree to market and sell my stuff regularly, on a monthly basis, and i agree to pay you 10% from profit on a monthly basis. The ideal, is to get to $2000 a day in Sales, that way, You can make $6000 every month. Not bad, i think. I will be adding more products to a my store, and there is a big chance to make some good money with them. The products are coming from China (high quality ones), and will be serving US market mostly, but later on planning to export to Europe as well.Your Job is to market and sell, whichever way You want. If you have Your ready audience, encourage to buy, if you have a blog, advertise there, if You have any other marketing channel, that You know will pay off, You can go with that. Your task is to make sure that product is selling. Everything is transparent, i can add You to the website system, so you can see, how much the store makes a day, and 10% from profit, after expenses is Yours. Do contact me if You have any questions, let me know what you think, and i will be more than happy to answer Your questions.
