Fashion Shows -: You can start by organizing a fashion show. You can pair up with other designers in the industry to stage a fashion show that you would use to showcase your designs. Fashion shows attract a lot of fashion enthusiasts and professionals in the industry. Owners of clothing boutiques may be able to pick some pieces they really loved on the runway to sell in their stores. You can also use your fashion show to promote a humanitarian cause.For instance, you can stage a fashion show to create awareness for cancer or HIV/AIDS and some of your earnings can go towards the financial support of that cause. This would not only draw the attention of fashion industry professionals, it would also draw the attention of the general public especially people who are passionate about the cause you are promoting.2. Increase your publicity -: You have to literarily rub your clothing line in the faces of the general public. This means using any means within your grip to promote your brand. This is where a marketing plan comes into play? Here is a sample clothing line marketing plan template you can use. First, you can ask bloggers to do a blog post on your clothing line. You can also ask for a feature article in a local newspaper where your brand can be talked about.If you are very good with penning down interesting words, you can ask to have your own fashion column in a magazine or newspaper, where you would talk about trends in the fashion industry and also promote your clothing line too. Another idea is to give out free samples to fashion bloggers and have them write about your brand on their blogs. You should also consider teaming up with fashion stylists to have them dress their clients up in your designs.3. Create your own website -: It is mandatory that you have your own website. These days, more people are embracing internet shopping and you should take advantage of that by creating your own website. After creating your website, you can employ search engine optimization techniques that you know to make your website highly ranked and more visible. You should also make your website easy to navigate. Most people cannot be bothered with a website that is too complex. You can also make your website fun by regularly posting video clips of your fashion shows, updating your content with new styles and offering promotional codes and discounts regularly.4. Event Hosting -: Another idea to employ is event hosting techniques. You can organize seminars and conferences that teach people how to dress. For instance there\u2019s a popular event known as \u201cdress for success\u201d where women are taught how to improve their public image and perception through appropriate dressing.You too can organize something similar and have your clothing designs displayed at the event so that attendees can also buy your stuffs so that they can start dressing for success.5. Tele-media Marketing -: You can also consider advertising using television, radio or billboards. You should also make out flyers and place them in public places or have people hand them out for you at bus parks, train stations, shopping malls, etc.", "url": "/projects/graphic-design/olabsfashion-com/", "title": "Olabsfashion.com"}, {"desc": "I have a website that I need to get sales to.
