They then fund raise, on social media and associating you with a great cause.We would like to team up with your sports centres and pools to help attract customers and fundraisers. The system allows fundraisers to log the name of their sports centre or pool and the member of staff that introduced them to the event and we can tell you, them, your managers and your staff how much they have helped to raise for charity. The aim is to incentivise your staff, sports centres, pools and customers to raise more money, stick to their goals, continue their membership and have some fun competition.The fitness benefits for participants1. Take the 66 day challenge. Research shows that on average it takes 66 days to form a new habit. Turn a resolution into a habit.2. Commit. If you choose to join us you are going to commit in writing to your friends and family and ask them for money in exchange for committing to complete the challenge.3. Buddy up. This site gives you the opportunity to form a team, whether it is real or virtual it is going to help you stick to the challenge.4. Talk about it. Tell your friends and family what you are doing and why you are doing it. They will help you on your way.5. Connect with fitness apps like Fitbit, Strava and MapMyFitnessWhats in it for the leisure trust/gym?When a participant signs up they are more likely to stay a member of the gym. typically gyms sign up lots of new members in January but 35% cancel by Easter so there is a business benefit for the gym. Gyms call this retention.What we are asking the leisure trusts is for their fitness instructors, receptionists etc to introduce their members to the event. we will provide posters and fliers and ask them to help us on their digital media.When participants register on the website they register as a member of their leisure trust, leisure centre or pool and the fitness instructor that introduced them.the website then has leader boards showing funds raised byparticipantleisure trustleisure centrefitness instructor, receptionist, pool attendant. the introducersparticipants can also create teamsthis system particularly regarding the instructors our sales force should keep people motivatedwe have a list of 60 leisure trusts representing 300 leisure centres and pools and there are more organisations. we have already sold the event to 55 leisure centres and have emails, ppt and other helpful sales materials and we know the typical sales issues and objections.
