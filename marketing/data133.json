Identify and prioritize private foundation and/or institutional donors from whom Muse Group would be eligible to receive grant funding; compile a proposal development plan for each prioritized donor.Excel-based data collection templates will be provided for both work streams (see attached).Media StrategyThe consultant will use Muse Group\u2019s pre-identified list of media outlets and competitors to identify and prioritize the best media outlets to be approached to promote its upcoming crowdfunding campaign. Specifically, the consultant will:1. Identify media outlets that have covered Callia\u2019s competitors (list of competitors provided) and add them to the media outlet candidate list.2. Rank each outlet on the candidate list by:\u2022\tRelevance: would their readers be interested in Callia?\u2022\tReadership: how much traffic does their site get? (e.g. via SEO for Chrome extension)\u2022\tReach: do they \u201cpush\u201d their content through email, newsletters, RSS feed, social media and other channels, or would they expect Callia to drive all of the traffic to their site?3.
