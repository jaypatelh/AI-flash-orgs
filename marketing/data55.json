Only one of them turned out to be legit on this website. Lets not waste each other's time if you dont think you can easily finish this project.I really look forward to establish a long-term business relationship with the best sourcing agent here!Thank you for reading this! :) I may have come off a bit harsh and serious but its to filter out trolls. Once you work with me and show results you will love to work with me again.To Recap the awarding & milestone release process:- To get awarded: give me the document proving you can get me samples that I want. (If you just give me pictures from google instead of pictures from the manufacturer I will report you for scamming me)- First Milestone released after: Gives the contact + catalog + reference + source + all for the manufacturers showed off before getting awarded.- Second Milestone released after: Order & Send samples to me, I confirm samples are what I wanted. (Will pay for the samples via PayPal or Skrill or just additional milestone here) Time is of essence, if you dont come online or answer late, or keep postponing, I will have cancel everything after 2 days and make an honest review.- Third & Last Milestone (most of the award) released after: Taking care of placing and establishing contact with the manufacturer for making this process a thing and repeating for mass orders and customization.
