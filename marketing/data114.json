I need someone to oversee the project of making people aware that this entrance exam to the chat room exists.The chat room we are creating should consist of people who:-really want to work on building a general artificial intelligence-already know the basics of deep learning-Can the person understand papers like \u201cHybrid computing using a neural network with external dynamic memory\u201d and \u201cLearning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent\u201d?-are able to commit to working full-time on this at some point-are fast learners and creative thinkers, whatever that means-Take 100 people at random.

The plan needs to be something that allows me to be convinced of this without out thinking about it too much. Actually I don't care too much what you are going to do or how you are going to spend the money, as long as you can convince me that you are spending it efficiently. The way I would like the plan to look like, heh, is like a mathematical proof that the money is spent well. Maybe one can even use words like, \"definition of _\" and \"proof of _\" and \"the _ lemma\" to get in the mind set. haha.
