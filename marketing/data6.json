This allows us to deliver cost-effective energy for our customers. Our in-house EPC expertise lowers system costs and our advanced in-house operations and maintenance capability allows us to increase power yields and monitor project performance near real-time. Coupled with our efficient financial strategy, we believe that we are able to offer low-cost solar power solutions at high efficiency yields. Our existing 250MW solar power farms have been successfully running in different countries however this capacity need to extend.U.S. Department of Energy, solar energy generation today costs around 13 cents per kilowatt-hour. This accounts for state and federal subsidies awarded to solar power and is nearly 14% more expensive than the cost of electricity provided by fossil fuels. The price and efficiency of solar panels have already fallen quite a bit to come down to this level, and research and development is underway to further decrease the cost of production.New materials known as perovskites have been incorporated into solar cells and have increased solar cell efficiency in laboratory tests, from a 3.8% efficiency in 2009 to just over 40% by 2018. If technological development in solar continues at this pace, PV electric generation could increase to produce 70% more energy per square meter of solar paneling in just a few short years.
