Logo's and more can be found at midatlanticfirst.org. My goal is to have a one page (2 sided design) that I can approach investors with and get them to commit 10k to our project.Mid-Atlantic FIRST Coalition Enthusiasts,Thank you for your continued participation in our coalition activities! As you are aware, the need to formalize the coalition was driven by several incidents, such as Hurricane Sandy and Winter Storm Jonas. These events highlighted the need for a way to assess and aggregate\u2014sometimes confusing and contradictory\u2014information across multiple state, county, and city jurisdictions and disseminate it through multiple channels available to e xxx. We are excited at the progress we have made to secure strong partnerships between the coalition and key public-sector agencies with the goal to understand the capabilities each side possesses to respond/share information during wide-scale and local emergency events.We have engaged partners at all levels to include the DC Homeland Emergency Management Agency, Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Maryland Emergency Management Agency, DC and Virginia Fusion Centers and many other local EOCs.Our outreach efforts have produced benefits to our membership including:\u00b7        U.S. Department of Treasury hosted tabletop exercise/workshop (September 14th)\u00b7        Participation in development/planning efforts for the Business Emergency Operations Center (BEOC) led by the MWCOG. The Mid-Atlantic FIRST coalition will be a key member of this effort.\u00b7        Tri-sector tabletop exercise (October)\u00b7        Attendance to and participation in development/planning of the Maryland Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) fall private/public scenario based exerciseWe are excited to begin this next phase of Mid-Atlantic FIRST coalition development in which we begin to formalize our organizational structure and governance. We have full time Director that is committed to building and maintaining a sustainable regional coalition.   Initially this directorship is funded by FS-ISAC .   Our next goal is to look at building our Founding Board of Directors and eventually setting dues that will enable our coalition to become self-funded. The topic has been discussed at several small group strategy meetings as well as our monthly member call. To launch this phase, we are introducing an opportunity for you to become one of the \u201cfounding member investors\u201d in the coalition.As a founding member, you would contribute a one-time investment ranging from 10K (Up) to secure a spot on our Founding Board of Directors and assist in the development of a dues structure for the larger membership base. Below are a few of the highlights we felt would be advantageous for our founding members:Founding Partner/Investor Benefits:\u00b7        Seat on board of directors \u2013 Drive strategy and direction\u00b7        Sliding scale % reduction in dues over 5 years (25,20,15,10,5)\u00b7        Early access/registration to training/events\u00b7        Recognition on public-facing website as founding partnerPlease take a moment to review this important opportunity and feel free to reach out if you have any questions. We are putting our founding member board in place in 2017 with the expectation of full member dues going into place during 2018.We know that maintaining a strong resilient workforce is more important than ever. I\u2019d love to discuss this opportunity. Would you be available to meet either in person (lunch) or via conference call sometime next week?Thank you!

We are driven because we know people's lives depend on our work.Alexion was established in the U.S. in 1992 and became a public company in 1996 (NASDAQ: ALXN).

In September 2017, the Company announced that it would relocate its headquarters to Boston, Mass., by mid-2018 and that New Haven would serve as the Company\u2019s Center of Excellence for its world-class complement research and process development teams. Alexion's employees around the world serve patients in approximately 50 countries.OUR BREAKTHROUGH PRODUCTSAlexion developed Soliris\u00ae (eculizumab), the world's first approved terminal complement inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) two life-threatening, ultra-rare disorders caused by uncontrolled complement activation. Soliris is also approved in the European Union for the treatment of patients with refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive. Marketing applications for Soliris for the treatment of this ultra-rare subset of MG patients have been accepted for review in the U.S. and Japan.Alexion also has two highly innovative enzyme replacement therapies for patients with life-threatening and ultra-rare metabolic disorders\u2014Strensiq\u00ae (asfotase alfa) for patients with hypophosphatasia (HPP) and Kanuma\u00ae (sebelipase alfa) for patients with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D).OUR FUTUREAlexion\u2019s ambition is to be the global leader in rare diseases by leveraging our 20+ years of expertise in complement biology and our capabilities in hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders to bring additional life-changing therapies to patients.", "url": "/projects/php/http-www-alexion-com/", "title": "http://www.alexion.com/"}, {"desc": "I just launched PayToClick site and need help for make it big.
