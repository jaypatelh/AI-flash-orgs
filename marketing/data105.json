There is also a video and online demo. Plus having a landing page URL you give out will make it easier to track your sales. Sales are done by credit card.It's recommended to approach local businesses near to you but of course however you want to reach out to prospects (phone, email, face-to-face) is up to you and happy to hear your ideas on this.
