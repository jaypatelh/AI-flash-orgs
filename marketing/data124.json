Trexseo is an online store that has an expanding product range of over 500 new products a day, but it has a unique financial opportunity. Every day around the world, people are influencing other people to buy things either deliberately(by suggesting that they do so) or unintentionally (by making others desire something they have like a new coffee mug, tablet or phone.) Trexseo taps into these interactions by allowing users to make accounts and sell products on the store to anyone. Every product that somebody buys because of their recommendation, the user will get a 10% commission without any fees and without ever having to buy or ship the product. People have began making careers off of this platform, as it takes away the limitations of traditional sales. No longer do you have to be limited to the types of products at one store or the number of products available. Trexseo is an ever-expanding store tapping into all genres. Traditional sales has a poor commission incentive, and it is still taxed heavily. Trexseo has a 10% commission rate with no fees or added taxes. We need people with more experience on the platform. Trexseo is offering all users who create an account through freelancer a 15% commission rate. All users who create an account will be given $1 in Trexseo credit, and they will receive an additional $5 in credit for every recommendation they give that results in an active user account. The real money is in the sales. The opportunity is immense. People who use Trexseo can make six or seven figures sending mass product recommendations and getting large commission, and even people who just recommend to friends and family can make thousands easily.
