We have other projects if this goes well.Our Charity Miricyl stands for Mental Illness Research in Children and Young Lives.The event (as pitched to a leisure trust or gym)Your staff introduce your members to the event. We see an introduction to the event being no more than a 3 minute conversation at a class, induction, around the pool or sports centre or even just a flyer handed out at reception.For people\u2019s New Year\u2019s resolution they sign up on our charity mobile website to achieve a goal to run, cycle, swim, step or attend gym classes for a period of 66 days. They then fund raise, on social media and associating you with a great cause.We would like to team up with your sports centres and pools to help attract customers and fundraisers. The system allows fundraisers to log the name of their sports centre or pool and the member of staff that introduced them to the event and we can tell you, them, your managers and your staff how much they have helped to raise for charity. The aim is to incentivise your staff, sports centres, pools and customers to raise more money, stick to their goals, continue their membership and have some fun competition.The fitness benefits for participants1. Take the 66 day challenge. Research shows that on average it takes 66 days to form a new habit. Turn a resolution into a habit.2. Commit. If you choose to join us you are going to commit in writing to your friends and family and ask them for money in exchange for committing to complete the challenge.3. Buddy up. This site gives you the opportunity to form a team, whether it is real or virtual it is going to help you stick to the challenge.4. Talk about it. Tell your friends and family what you are doing and why you are doing it. They will help you on your way.5. Connect with fitness apps like Fitbit, Strava and MapMyFitnessWhats in it for the leisure trust/gym?When a participant signs up they are more likely to stay a member of the gym. typically gyms sign up lots of new members in January but 35% cancel by Easter so there is a business benefit for the gym. Gyms call this retention.What we are asking the leisure trusts is for their fitness instructors, receptionists etc to introduce their members to the event. we will provide posters and fliers and ask them to help us on their digital media.When participants register on the website they register as a member of their leisure trust, leisure centre or pool and the fitness instructor that introduced them.the website then has leader boards showing funds raised byparticipantleisure trustleisure centrefitness instructor, receptionist, pool attendant. the introducersparticipants can also create teamsthis system particularly regarding the instructors our sales force should keep people motivatedwe have a list of 60 leisure trusts representing 300 leisure centres and pools and there are more organisations. we have already sold the event to 55 leisure centres and have emails, ppt and other helpful sales materials and we know the typical sales issues and objections. There aren't gate keepers really, mental health for kids opens the door, it is just finding the right person with time to talk to you. And then typically there are a number of decision makers to influence.If you go to a gym and have some knowledge of mental illness this will help but is not essential.", "url": "/projects/sales/sell-january-charity-event-gyms/", "title": "Sell January charity event to gyms"}, {"desc": "Hello there,I'm starting a brand from ground up and would like to have a major present on facebook with regularly posting infographics and post things to facebook through our websites blog.Please give me a price for running the whole facebook page with all of the content and specify in details what your price includes of texts, infographics and perhaps maybe animated videos.
