Have a clear goal in mind when doing SEM [search engine marketing] Keep your target customer in mind when writing ads.  Don't mislead customers. Use negative keywords.  Target my ads. Implement all three types of keyword targeting exact match, phrase match, broad match into my targeting strategy.  Bid the most for exact match keywords and the least for broad match keywords.  Also, I should separate ad groups by keyword type, in addition to category, to keep the campaign well-organized. It should ALWAYS be tested.  Once we identify my AdWords campaign goal/action, plan various tests to try to maximize my outcome.  These tests [should] span the entire funnel, beginning with identification of keywords to bid on and which ad copy to use, to the design of the landing page and any follow-on email marketing campaigns.  But I should run one test at a time.  I need for a specialist to create variations of my ads and monitor which gets the best click through rate, the lowest cost per click, the highest number of conversions, etc.  Implement conversion tracking.  Being able to see what keywords are triggering a sale or a lead is huge in bid management and optimizing the account to increase ROI [return on investment] Setting up conversion tracking is critical.  Without proper tracking in place, I cannot trace and promote the successful keywords, ads or keyword themes.  Moreover, conversion tracking allows ongoing optimization based on the data but also gives me direct insight into the ROI for my efforts. Monitor and tweak my campaigns.  Doing this at least once a week can keep my costs low by eliminating ineffective keywords.  AdWords settings can be adjusted throughout the duration of each campaign.  Always make changes while the campaign is running [example..pausing keywords and ads with low click-through rates, lowering keyword bids if a campaign is hitting daily budget limits and adding new versions of copy if ads are under performing.  Make SEARCH TERM REPORTS my best friend.  They can help me identify low click-through rates, higher cost-per-click keywords, decreased time on site and a host of other issues that can negatively affect my bottom line.  Using the search term report, I can clear out keywords that have become obsolete or are low performers and replace them with new keywords that will hopefully perform better.  And last, I want to use Google's Remarketing feature.  As long as we configure it correctly in Google Analytics, Smart Lists leverages Google's big data capabilities to track who has visited my website.  Google the pushes that data back into AdWords for me to use in my Adwords campaigns for remarketing.  It's a powerful tool that not many people know about or have talked about for making the most of my ad dollars.", "url": "/projects/marketing/hire-marketing-specialist-15060107/", "title": "Hire a Marketing Specialist"}, {"desc": "Looking for someone to optimize my amazon listing and creating PPC campaign on Facebook and Amazon.", "url": "/projects/internet-marketing/create-manage-ppc-campaign-15060176/", "title": "Create/Manage a  PPC Campaign"}, {"desc": "Call my leads and set appointments for real estate sales.", "url": "/projects/telemarketing/appointment-setter-15060153/", "title": "Appointment Setter"}, {"desc": "graphic designer- banners- facebook ads, product images and other graphic worklogo creationlooking for someone who can work with me on a permanant basis, will discuss further in private chat!", "url": "/projects/graphic-design/hire-graphic-designer-15060127/", "title": "Hire a Graphic Designer"}, {"desc": "input web leads into saleforce plus look up addresses and phone numbers", "url": "/projects/internet-marketing/data-entry-into-salesforce/", "title": "data entry into salesforce"}]
