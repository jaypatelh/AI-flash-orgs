PayPal needs:1. Supplier Contact Info.- This is the supplier's phone number and address to confirm the origin of the goods am selling.2. Invoices:-Proofs that I own the merchandise am selling. Helpful documents include copies of copies of sales receipts, itemized lists of goods sold, and original bills of sale.-Invoices must show date of purchase, name of the wholesaler or supplier, a description of items sold, quantity of the items purchased and the amount of money paid for the merchandise.MY BUSINESS INFOI have a website through which clients can access academic tutorials at some fee. These tutorials are prewritten and have been uploaded by the users such as students who have completed their courses or resale. From my online research, it\u2019s not easy convincing PayPal that I own and create my own items for sale by the users registered on the site. PayPal won\u2019t understand this or may treat it as a risky business and may even close my PayPal account. They only need proof as described above, that\u2019s how they work. No other way.WHAT I NEED:Quite simple. I\u2019m looking for someone who can create or provide the above documents (Invoices and Supplier Info) to me at a fee so I can use to recover my PayPal account. They must look very professional and realistic. I don\u2019t need Photoshopped documents as they can be detected and that will wreck my account and make all these efforts futile.I prefer someone with a company or business dealing with academic related materials and tutorials. I\u2019ll convince PayPal that I outsource the tutorial items from your company and resell them.Just provide with the invoices, and your business that I\u2019ll send to PayPal and then they can verify my business as authentic.My items as contained in the server are serially arranged according to the Item IDs for easy upload. This will also enable creating the invoices easier as you really don\u2019t need to think of item names to write. The following is a screenshot of the downloadable items form my server\u2019s backend.As you can see, the items are listed in the website according to their IDs (the figures). So when you create the invoice, you may just specify the list of IDs or ranges that I\u2019ll tell you, quantity (number) and their price plus other info described above under invoice requirements and this will help me.Can you do this?
