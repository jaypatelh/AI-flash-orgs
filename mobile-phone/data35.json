When we publish an issue, user receives an email notifying them new issue is available, with a link to log into the subscriber site to download a pdf (user\u2019s email address stamped at the bottom). The app will push a notification new issue is available. Example: The Economist\u2019s subscriber app. Articles look but they are mobile friendly \u2013 just one column. Ads are accommodated. There is an audio version \u2013 voice artists record all the articles.  (Want the ability to disable this so that the audio version) Dashboard to upload the pdf  & drop in the content for the mobile version, & upload audio files. Newsletter has up to approximately 15 sections in an issue, not all appear each week.  Dashboard-tick boxes next to the sections that will appear that week. Tick a box-a field for text would appear. Option to upload up to two graphics for each section-appear in the app alongside text. For audio, an admin would be able to assign sections to voice artists, with login credentials. The system would assemble all the files & alert the admin when the audio version is ready for approval. App functionality-request a free trial or to subscribe; anyone can download the app & would see the first five lines of an item then option to 1) login if a subscriber, 2) subscribe or 3) request a free trial. Same functionality available on the WP site. Newsletter is published on Sunday nights \u2013 the content in the PDF & in the mobile app must be launched at the same time.Obj B: A sub with 1 seat would be able to log in & download issues & search archives (need to add old issues without generating new-issue notifications to users.) Subs would see an option to add additional users to their subscription for an additional fee. Subs with multiple seats or unlimited seats can add or delete users at email domain (or multiple email domains, if an admin approves more than one domain). An admin would be able to import all sub info as it currently exists prior to launch. Admin would be able to establish an account for someone who subscribes offline. Fully automated password administration, recovery & autolock shared accounts is required. Logins would be synched between the subscriber site & app \u2013 same login for one email address, & every paid sub would have the same level of access (to d/l pdf, search archives & read or listen on the app). Non-subs would be able to request free 4-week trials. Requires admin approval (designate an admin to receive requests & approve). Issues would go out, & app access would be available. At the end, trial subs get a series of messages inviting them to subscribe. E-commerce functionality would enable them to do so with any number of seats or they could request an invoice (emailed manually offline), preferably with current CC processor & merchant services bank. The account admin would be notified of subscriptions or additional seats purchased. Also need customizable/flexible checkout pages.Dashboards: 1) Content admin (to upload pdf, add mobile content, assign sections to voice artists & approve audio) 2) Voice artist (to see assigned text & upload audio files) 3) Account admin (to establish & edit account access \u2013 also view user engagement stats, both aggregated & per user) 4) Subscriber (to download issues, search archives & \u2013 where applicable \u2013 edit sub-users) 5) Sub-user (to download issues & search archives)", "url": "/projects/php/content-delivery-system-mobile-app/"}, {"title": "New Code Source Subway Surfer,Temple Run for android and IOS", "desc": "Hello,We are looking for code source of similar   Subway Surfer,Temple Run  game that will works on andriod and ios device s:[url removed, login to view] Itegrated.[url removed, login to view] Ad integrated[url removed, login to view] game documentation[url removed, login to view] support to run the app and generate working apk.5.In-app purchase option[url removed, login to view] the appIf any one has the code source he is welcome.thank you.note:send me the apk file to test the appany question is welcomAdditional information submittedI'm looking for someone who has the source code ready (Dev+Design)", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/new-code-source-subway-surfer/"}, {"title": "TripAdvisor Review on Mobile Device without App", "desc": "Hi,Need a solution to enable customers to leave a review on their mobile phones without having TA app.Pls connect if you have a solution.Thanks", "url": "/projects/php/tripadvisor-review-mobile-device-without/"}, {"title": "Project for Nimbyist Technologies", "desc": "Hi Nimbyist Technologies, I noticed your profile and would like to offer you my project.

I am a construction project manager and my partner is a web-developer. We are based in Munich Germany and are looking for a long-term partner for future projects.We are in need of somebody or a team that can develop an photo management and archiving app that works on Android & Apple Smartphones and Tablets. It is called PICTOCOM.We will handle design, but you will have to program it.WHAT THE APP IS ABOUT:The construction site manager takes a lot of photos of the houses and work during the construction process because he has to document everything. It is a lot of work to export those pictures, rename them and organize them. That is why we wanted to create an app that does that for them.The Admin will be able to invite project managers (Alpha Users). The project managers will be able to create a folder structure for every project. They will then be able to take pictures in the correct folder. The project managers can invite site managers (Beta Users). The Beta users can choose in which folder they take pictures but they can not create them. This way everybody in the team saves their pictures in the same folders. The folder structure is created by the app and the pictures are exported in this folder structure automatically.PICTOCOM requirements:1.\tServer and Online Web-App:2.\tWeb server: Apache or Windows Server 20163.\tDatabase: Mysql4.\tFor Frontend and Backend interface work with PHP 75.\tXML construction for the structure6.\tMobile Frontend Feature:7.\tUser Login and Logout Feature8.\tAdmin and User roles9.\tCamera Interface10.\tTemporary local save photo data on the Mobil phone11.\tAutomatic creation of folder structure from Admin and User account12.\tUploading from temporary photo- and file data13.\tUploading files comes to the Online Server14.\tFrontend Multi-Language option15.\tMulti-Language file for all words (EN-file, DE-file, NL-file\u2026..)16.\tPlatform independent for all Mobile devices17.

THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE.What I want to change------------------------------------1. Change the background image of the app (currently water droplets)2. A native device icon appears above the top right section of the webview. Update that icon to receive JSON. If no JSON is received, or if it is empty, hide the icon. If it receives objects, they will determine what links will appear and the left slide bar when the icon is clicked. The links should be native to the device and allow user to set new URL for the webview.3. Put a loading icon, which I will provide in the center-middle of the webview. When the app is started, and the webview is still loading its content, this icon should remain visible.4. Remove the old app registration page where the user enters hexadecimal characters inside fields.6. The JSON that is returned will have information such as the icon, app name, url, etc.7. If the user is not authenticated, and they first open the app, they will be redirected to a login screen. After login, the webview should then disappear and the background image of the app should appear (image for your reference provided).", "url": "/projects/android/modify-ios-android-app-15549500/"}, {"title": "Gif animation", "desc": "Want custom gif animation made", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/gif-animation/"}, {"title": "Need Android Expert", "desc": "I need an android expert.If you have wealth of experience in android development, we can discuss more my projects.Please bid.Thank you.", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/need-android-expert-15549519/"}, {"title": "ChekPleaseApp", "desc": "I am looking for someone who can integrate push notifications in my hybrid mobile app.Technologies used-Ionic 3, Firebase.I will share more details with selected freelancer.** Note - Highly preferred candidates with IONIC and FIREBASE experience.", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/chekpleaseapp/"}, {"title": "Design a ebook (source pdf) that support andord and IOS system", "desc": "1. ebook support PDF2. support IOS and Android3 more info talk online", "url": "/projects/graphic-design/design-ebook-source-pdf-that/"}, {"title": "APP / PHP - Details in the attachment", "desc": "Finish a started project.The project is almost done, but the developer was suppose to finish it 2 months ago.

It is important that each person choose a task that provides \"personal\", \"coupled\" and \"family\" satisfaction. Being able to achieve the optimization of the times could be achieved without major inconveniences with a correct organization. People can additionally add tasks that they want to perform for example 30 minutes of exercise, reading, etc. Finally, what would be achieved would be greater harmony, less chaos in daily tasks, people learn to plan and organize more efficiently and be able to have at the end of the day the satisfaction of having achieved what they have proposed.
