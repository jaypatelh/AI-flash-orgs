(A log out button would need to be added to the settings view of the app)Once the user is logged in, it simply shows a webview. This is all served from the web server. However the user then can select a product from the webview and there are 2 buttons on that page, 1 will download and store some JSON data to an SQLite database on the device. The 2nd button downloads and stores a PDF manual and then would open it with the PDF reader that is already in use in the app (PlugPDF)I can record a video that shows all of this to better explain.Many thanks,Andrew", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/update-android-app-15329201/"}, {"title": "form page to open responsive on all tab", "desc": "data base has to show in admin and  somoene available now to do it in 1hr max my budget is 20$ onlyRegistrationTitle...First Name...Last Name...Nationality...country codeMobile Number...Email...Information...", "url": "/projects/php/form-page-open-responsive-all/"}, {"title": "I need 3 different aspects of pr", "desc": "I need 3 things for my project1.

The client will not have access to the online website, but instead will have an app which they receive their claim updates on, update their own claim details where necessary, and have access to any relevant claim information.From the insurer\u2019s perspective they finally begin their digital path and reduce both their inbound and outbound calls.

User chooses currency pair for the the 5 exchanges (major currency pairs - can be from coinindex or similar place)3. Each exchange will be a tile on the screen. So a total of 5 tiles.4. Each exchange tile will:- show latest crypto currency balance in BTC and in selected currency pair- show latest bid price- show latest bid price with exchange fees included (i.e. latest bid price plus latest bid price*0.25%)- a buy button next to it for buying instantly- editable field for % buying exchange fees. Default is 0.25%- show latest ask price- show latest ask price with exchange fees included (i.e. latest ask price minus latest ask price*0.25%)- a sell button next to it for selling instantly- editable field for % exchange fees for selling. Default is 0.25%- a button for funds transfer (this is a link to go to the exchange)5. Highlight in a different color the exchange tile and sell price with commission and the exchange tile and lowest buy price with commission. This will be two different exchanges. Move these to be the two tiles. This way, the five exchange tiles can be in three rows 2+2+1.6. All prices will be changing dynamically in realtime7.

App should be deployable on mobile or desktop or cloud.10.
