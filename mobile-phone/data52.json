So, to toggle back to the keypad (while on emoji display), just tap on the text field.3. IMAGE SENDING VIA CHAT:What we have now is When you send image via chat, the images are distorted. Stretched or squashed.What I want is to fix the image distortion and allow for the ability to select multiple images and edit the images before sending; like; pencil on it, crop and send full resolution image.4. MESSAGE HISTORY DISPLAY:What I have now is, when you open a friend's chat page, Your old message history does not display your latest message. You have to slide/scroll up a few messages up to be able to see the last message sent.What I want is that, Once you open the message page it should display the latest chat history.5. CHAT HISTORY FUNCTIONS:I want to add the function that, when you press the chat speech/text balloon, you should see options to; DELETE, COPY, FORWARD and probably, recall the message. We don;t have this functions yet.======FEEDS SECTION (Like TWITTER)1. We have a Custom image layout display - But again, the images are distorted (Stretched and squashed). We want this fixed.2. The app crashes when you try to access phone's album or take a pic to post. So we want this fixed and add the functions to take instant pic or take short video and post.We have all the UI done and set. And the App is already on Apple Store for testing only.Also I have the UI design for all the changes I want you to make.
