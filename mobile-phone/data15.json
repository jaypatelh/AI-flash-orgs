Followed by a verification process either by mail or SMS depending on the users choice. That is, verifying the phone number and email. Subsequent profile update will be: Location, Contact address, Profile picture, State of Origin, Local Government of origin, Means of Identification, BVN, Register one or more commercial bank account, Next of kin - name/contact details, Users should be able to create multiple savings target with a timeframe and there should be a progress indicator for each target. For example a user may decide to save 100000NGN in a year for an accommodation. Users should be able to save on the platform by initiating a transfer from their commercial bank account either manually or activating a standing order (recurrent billing) The platform shall have a three way omni channel for cash collection viz; - through a payment gateway - by direct deposits through agents meaning provision should be made for field staff to register on theplatform and have the application installed on their phones, tablets and or PC so that they can collect money directly from customers anywhere anytime while the customers account on the platform will be updated instantly and a notification of transaction sent to them either by mail or SMS. (Paga and diamond bank does this) - and through an electronic pin recognized only by the platform. Users should be able to apply for and get a loan on the platform while the platform should be able to calculate interest and balance payable at a given time as well as keep track of the process. Non user should be able to fund users account. User should be able to move cash within the platform ie from one user account to another user account. Users should be able to move cash outside the platform ie to a commercial bank account. Users should be able to update their account profile exception of their names and the assigned account number. Users should be able to view their transaction within a specified period of time, say for the last two or three months. The platform should automatically log out any user within 5 minutes of inactivity. Every user profile should automatically come with a general savings target and loan account apart from the one user will create themselves. If a user does not set any target, then all cash lodgement progress should be reflected on the general pouch, but all loan transaction should reflect on the loan pouch.
