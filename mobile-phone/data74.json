I particularly like the feel created by tinder.Purpose.To help doctors learn new facts and then retain information into the longterm memory. I would like to have both premium and free service (please see below)For the users1) A question would appear on front of card.There will be a timer in the top right corner (count down from 1 min)2) By clicking on the card or if the timer runs out, the card will flip over and reveal the answer.3) Then similar to tinder, if the user felt they answered correctly, they swipe right, if they got the question wrong they swipe left.If user gets question wrong, the question will be reshown to them in 10 minutes.If they get the question right, the card will be reshown in one day time. If they get the question right in a day time, it will show again n 2 days time. If they get it right in 2 days time, it will show again in 4 days time, if they get it right in 4 days time it will show again in 8 days time and so on. However, if they get the question wrong at any point and they swipe left, it will reset and go back to 10 minutes.I want to be able to have premium and free users. Free users can upgrade at any point. The free users will be able to see a limited number of cards a day (which I will be able to set. The free users will also see adverts after a set number of cards played.  The premium users will not be shown any adverts and there will be no limit to how many cards they can see each day.The premium users will also be able to create their own cards by clicking an icon on the bottom of the screen, this will allow them to personalise their deck of cards; for example if they come across new information from clinical practice, they can simply create a new card and keep storage of this new information.Each card will have a coloured icon related to the specialty it is related to. For example if it a cardiology question, there will be a red heart in the top left.If it is a respiratory question, it will have a blue lung in the left corner. This should appear in a circular tag.Premium users will be able to select which specialty they would like to revise from their user preference area.In the user preference area,User can decide which specialty they want to revise (can be multiple)They can also set an exam time, from this date \u2013 the programme will indicate how many cards must be seen each day.For me to be able to write the cards to be seen on the app:I need a front sheet .
