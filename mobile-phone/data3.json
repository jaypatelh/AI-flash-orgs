We know another open source blockchain that could be cloned (no legal implications) and their technology would be very suitable for the purpose of this project for the following stages. No need to start everything from scratch. On the contrary, cloning such blockchain and making it run smoothly (24/7, no stop) is enough for the purposes of the first stage.As soon as the blockchain is created and works smoothly, the work is complete and stage 1 will be considered over.

Preferably the designer will have previously worked directly with developers on successfully launched mobile applications for both iOS and Android. The timeline is expedited; we would like to have most digital assets available before December 1. Again, we are not looking for UI from scratch -- rather, final refinements to existing wireframes, and conversion to the assets. The app itself is a specialized group chat app. The product flow in opening the app and creating/joining group chats is similar to existing group chat apps (think WhatsApp or GroupMe). The app has one specialized feature that adds two screens, otherwise the interface is very similar as well (no reinventing the wheel).
