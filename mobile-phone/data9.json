All data/information will be saved on the application. No internet required. I will want ads on the application to generate some ROI. I would like the application to run on android and ios. The application shouldn't be too difficult since it is only referencing material.______________________________________________________________________________________Scope of application:The application is tailored to help police officers on traffic stops. A quick look on the app should help them know what penal codes have been violated and what section is charged.Example:A citizen runs a red light in the state of California. The officer conducts a traffic stop and decides to write a ticket. The application will give a quick reference to the penal code section which is 21453 (a) VC - Failure to stop at a solid red light. The application will also give a brief description of the violation.Application layout:Home page - Will have 4 sections; Penal code references, age calculator, recommended court date, and settings.Specific Details (Penal Code):The penal code section will have a list of possible violations such as Stop signs, License/Registration, Vehicle Equipment, Towing Authority, etc. I will provide a full list of each section frequently used in law enforcement. There should also be a simple way to edit the words and listing in each section. Laws change and I would like to be able to edit the laws and sections if there are changes in the future.Example:Stop signs \u2014>  list 21453(a) VC \u2014>   details on the violation of 21453(a) VCSpecific Details (Age Calculator):In this section, I would to be able to enter a date of birth (DOB) in order to quickly determine someone\u2019s age. For Example, if someone was born on October 1, 1989, the application should show that with this birth date, the citizen is 28 years old.Specific Details (Recommended court date):This section should provide a court date to the officer that is 8 weeks out from todays date. Example, if today is January 1, 2017, the application should show a court date of the specific date length of February 20 - 24. In other words, the application will show a possible date of Monday - Friday. Monday through Friday are the only days the courts are open.Now I foresee a possible problem on the development in this section. First, if the court date is a holiday, then the courts will be closed. So the given court date will not work.Solution, aside from being able select a date 8 weeks in advance. I would like the user to be able to change this to 1 of 4 selections. The selections be will change the future date to either 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 7 weeks, or 8 weeks.The user should also be able to pick specific day (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, etc.) aside from editing the weeks. I believe if the user is allowed to set up 8 weeks out and a specific day of wednesday, given its January 1, 2017, the application should show February 22, 2017. This date will change week to week. The change will occur on a Saturday and following the next day, it should show the next weeks date on Wednesday, which would be March 1, 2017.Example:8 weeks out \u2014> Wednesday \u2014> from todays date 1/1/17 should show 2/22/178 weeks out \u2014> Wednesday \u2014> from todays date 1/9/17 should show 3/1/178 weeks out \u2014> Wednesday \u2014> from todays date 4/7/17 should show 5/24/17Specific Details (settings):Settings should include the ability to send an email for any suggestions. I will provide an email account to receive these messages.Also I would like the ability to change the color of the background to a sold black contras. Many officers work during the night, so having the ability to change from a lighter background to a sold black background would be easier on the eyes.Return on investment (ROI):Banners ads will most likely be the only source of income for this application. It is essential to be able to include a banner ad on this application to have some return on investment.Platform:This application should be developed for both Apple\u2019s IOS and Android. Specific layout should be set out for phone displays.Time length: 2-3 week turn aroundPayment: Specified before development.", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/hire-app-developer-15635462/"}, {"title": "To jailbreak my iphone 7 running iOS 11.0.3 , to utilize all te power that is possible", "desc": "I want cydia or a alternative if not possible, tweaks and everything, i want to be able to do things with my phone none else can I want full control,", "url": "/projects/ios-development/jailbreak-iphone-running-ios-utilize/"}, {"title": "iOS/Android App, Similar to Tinder", "desc": "I need an iOS/Android app developed with similar swiping features to Tinder, more details will be discussed over private chat.", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/ios-android-app-similar-tinder-15661254/"}, {"title": "Develop  ios and android vpn apps client using openvpn open source code.", "desc": "i want put admob ads in OpenVPN Connect appcan any one help me ?i dont have code source!!", "url": "/projects/android/develop-ios-android-vpn-apps/"}, {"title": "Mobile App Design", "desc": "I need 4 -6 screens designed for a mobile app. I will need a functioing version to see in InVision.

This could be via fill in forms or by text box pop up.  User previews both the front and back of their design and then saves.  User can buy design and if so, checks out to pay.  Design is set to our printing company and we print the card and mails it to the User.The template has to be printer ready so that we can download the design and send directly to the printer without have to fuss with the design.
