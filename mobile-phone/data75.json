The app is used to create a set of tasks that I require followup on. I identify the person that owes me a deliverable, add a due date, add some notes about it and store it on our server.  The server then periodically sends the person doing the work a reminder to provide a status. This status is stored on the server and at the end of each day a summary of all of my open asks is shown to me. Thereby highlighting who I actually need to follow up with in person.The focus of the App is optimize a persons time to only reach out to those that are not providing updates, vs remove any need to ever followup with people directly.I have the server components being built right now.  There will be a REST/JSON based API that the App will need to communicate with. The UI is also being built at the moment and will be delivered before the project starts.The high level list of screens I believe this App will require are as follows.1. Splash screen2. Sign in1. Via either email or cell number3. Sign up1. with email and/or cell number4. Subscription screen1. Customers pay $x / month to utilize the service, so they\u2019ll need to be able to start, pause and remove their subscription5. Help screen1. Just some high level explanations on how to use the App6. Contact screen1. Email details7. About screen1. Maybe combine with above Contact screen?2. Allows us to display legal banners for any 3rd party libraries etc as well as the version of the App for debugging purposes8. Create a task for follow up1. Add the persons email/cell number2. Add any other people that require notification of this status (BCC type thing)3. Add a description4. Add a due date5. Add a priority9. List tasks being tracked and see current status1. An overview of all current tasks in an overview format for me to see up to the minute status vs waiting for the end of day summary10. Review history of a task1. Selects an individual task and see the chronological history of all interactions around that task11. Delete a task12. List tasks that I need to respond to1. If someone is waiting on me for some feedback, I should be able to see an ordered list of all of those, allowing me to select them to provide feedback13. Provide status updates for tasks1.
