Using the camera and OCR engine, the app will scan the number sequence.2. The app will ask the user to topup or transfer the fund to other phone number2a. Topup: the app will add prefix (eg, *113*) and suffix(eg. #) to the scanned number. And insert the whole sequence to phone Dial and dial it.2b. Transfer: the app will ask the phone number to transfer. Then it will add the prefix/suffix to the scanned number according to the choice of service carrier.

The whole app is about providing an effortless and quick solution so people don't have to enter all the numbers manually.Extra: I would like the app to generate income through ads but also through providing a service/connivence fee (say K0.45).
