Creating a certain number of virtual numbers (for instance, 1 million members).2. Registering these numbers in Telegram.3. Joining them to the specified channels (without any limitations on number of channels).4. Viewing (visiting) all published posts (with an adjustable speed).For more details, you can install Telegram on your Phone.- ways to design the application.There are two ways to create the application:1. Using API of Telegram (given the access to channels in this method).2. work with Mobile Telegram (to the best of our knowledge, similar softwares use this method) (recommended).For virtual numbers, a combination of bluestack and other softwares such as Textnow can be used.The reason we recommend Textnow is due to ease of register compared to other programs. furthermore, it don\u2019t need another numbers for creating an account.And finally, the lifetime of each account should be changed from 3 months (Default mode) to 1 year.If you have done a similar work already, or you know a better way to perform the project, we would be thankful if you explain it for us and then do it.Please let us know your requested cost and time who you needed for the project.Regards.", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/application-for-creating-members-for/"}, {"title": "Update Pods Error", "desc": "trying to build a project .. but unable to do that because of problem in updating pods.. whenever i try \"pod update\" or \"pod install\" i get[!] Could not automatically select an Xcode project.
