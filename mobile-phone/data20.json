User/Visitor App:- Users Can register using facebook, Google+, Phone Number and these details should be captured in backend DB- Can login, logout on the app- Can ask questions- Can pay in-app.- If there are no free questions for the user, they can still post but system will tell them to pay before it really reaches to admin. I believe Google payment will be integrated. Post payment the question gets sends to the backend admin.- Can set their profile after login into app, like full name, DOB, Time of Birth,  City of Birth, email etc.. These details to be stored in backend DB.- Can rate the answer, 1-5 stars - which then also gets stored in DB- There should be a placeholder at the bottom of the app to show banner ad. Put testing ad code from admob.- User first login should be welcome with a message which should be configurable from backend- Can receive app notifications when admin sends a message from backend.2. Admin:- Can login / logout from the backend- Can configure the system with some pre-defined settings like in-app amount, system auto-generated messages, how many free questions will be given to users.- So for ex., if there is 1 question free setup in the backend. The users in the APP will get a free question and for next question they have to do in app purchase.- Can create, edit, delete, list questions- The question list should show up latest first and there should be action items against each question : action 2 buttons: 'Answer' and 'Answer and Give Credit'. 'Answer and Give Credit' will give another question free for user along with the answer. 'Answer' will only send answer to user. There should be another button against each user \"Send Message\" which will send app notification to the user.- There should be an option to send message to all users also.- Will receive notifications via email and on dashboard for all questions.- Can see list of all users along with whatever questions they have asked and their profile details- Theme is already purchased for backend..3. General Requirements:- Users can ask questions but if it's not free, they will ask but application will seek in app google purchase. There should be a field in the backend- App and backend should have  english, hinglish and Hindi- We will share licensed backend admin theme to be used.- Users should be able to use the APP when offline (not on net).- Also, for ex., if user is offline (not on net) and CRM is replying, the answer should reach user when they gets connected to internet next time.- Crashlytics is required- Slider menu from right or left. Prefer right.- Slider menu comes with some sub-menu items- APP should work on both mobile and tablets.- Support till latest android- mySQL and CodeIgniter preferred.- Code should be latest Android Studio ready.4. Workflow:USER REGISTER - LOGIN - GET BONUS QUESTION (as setup in backend) and SYSTEM SENDS AUTO WELCOME MESSAGE - USER ASKS QUESTION - QUESTION ASSIGNED TO Admin as New Status and Admin can answer back to user from the backend and there should be a notification to the user on the app and the email", "url": "/projects/php/build-android-app-admin-panel/"}, {"title": "Write an Android application", "desc": "Need groceries Android app", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/write-android-application-15617615/"}, {"title": "Mobile development", "desc": "I need an Android app.  I would like it designed and built.
