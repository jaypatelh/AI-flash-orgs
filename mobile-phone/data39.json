If you cannot get the quality work done in 7 days, DO NOT waste my time. It's very important that i need quality guaranteed app within 7 days of awarding project.-----------I am looking to get a private shopify app developed.The app is like this:[url removed, login to view]However above app is too advanced. The app that i want should:1) On install, it should also upload a CSV file called products (which is just a shopify product file)2) If that specific product is sold (based on tag) then it shows in apps dashboard under 'Pending' section.3) [Important part] every product and its variant should automatically be assigned a random SKU number however that same 'random' sku number should be connected to a specific SKU number that we would provide you. So basically it should have an app database. So, when that product is sold, it's random SKU match with the SKU as in database and update a price in user's dashboard under pending (Supplier price )4) The amount due under 'Pending', once paid, move to 'fulfilment' and once we fulfill item, we need a backend from where we can update customer's order as fulfilled and enter tracking information.5) Customer should have option to change information like Address and size of variant while it's in pending and once customer pay for it, we could only received updated information.6) Customer (the one who installed app) should have 'billing' option where he can see all past payments made to us.7) If we issue refund from backend, customer should see it in the app, under that specific order.8) Other functions of same app.9) Paste this line in your comment (I Love My Work) only then i would even read your proposal, this shows you have read the project till here.So there would be an app with dashboard for customer and backend for us. Backend needs to be easy to operate and we should be able to perform action on specific shopify store (who installed our app).Please note these are not all requirements, as i am personally not from technical background, its not possible for me to list all. You need to look at that app and decide.Time Frame: Need this app ready in 7 Days. If you cant do it, let's not waste our time.Milestone Terms: If you have more then 97% project completion records and atleast 50+  (4.8 rank minimum ) reviews, i could do 100% milestone upfront.Project budget includes 1 year of after sales service (AMC) in case if app stop working for ANY reason, you need to update it.

NEW TASK SCREEN OPENS . Input boxes: task name , task objective. Then a button ADD FIRST STEP IN THE TASK to add task steps, with once a STEP is created, user can add NEXT STEP, and so on, as many steps as he wants , add a finish date and click SAVE.USER SCREEN has list of existing tasks.Each task will show 1) task name 2) task objective 3) finish date, 4) next step and DONE BUTTON 5) EDIT / DELETE buttonThe basic principle is that the app will display for each task, the NEXT STEP. Once a step is finished user can click the DONE button. Once DONE button is clicked he is now presented with the NEXT STEP from the entered steps. Once he is on the last step, he is presented with the FINISH TASK button.There will be a log button for each task that will take him to a text screen that shows when the task was created, which steps are finished and dates and times steps were finished , which steps remain etc etc.Users have to login /signup.

For each carousel, we will provide you with 13 to 150 images that the user must be able to rapidly swipe forward and backwards through (creating a sort of rapid \u2018animation\u2019 by switching the images quickly).

Each carousel and video will be accompanied by a link to a corresponding Product Info screen.4. Magazine screen- We will provide a PDF file that needs to readable inside the application.- The PDF file can be bundled with the application or downloaded after the application has been installed.- Users will be able to swipe back and forth to move to different pages within the document.- The PDF will likely be under 50 pages, and each page will contain text, images, and hyperlinks which can be opened in a web view within the application.\u2028- After initial download, the PDF magazine must be readable if the user does not have internet connectivity.5.
