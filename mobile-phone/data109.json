Upon visiting the booth, the tablets will be mounted to the table and will allow users to play.1. In order to play, a user is forced to enter their name and email and/or phone number in the event they win a prize, this will also include a checkbox that states we can or cannot add them to our mailing list2. Once they have entered the required information, a screen will pop up with instructions on how to play the game, the user is responsible for \u2018catching a fish\u2019 and the largest fish caught from the event will be the winner of the prize for that event.3. Once they click \u2018Okay\u2019 it will show them the pond, ( [url removed, login to view] ) where they will use their finger to catch a fish.4. In order to catch a fish, the user touches the fish and must follow it around the screen until the \u2018catch meter\u2019 fills up to full. The larger the fish, the harder it will be to catch, but the definitely should never exceed \u2018medium\u2019. As they follow the fish and the catch meter fills up, the tablet could vibrate a little showing the \u2018fight\u2019 with the fish.5. Once the user has followed the fish with their finger long enough that the catch meter is full, it will present a screen showing the type and weight of the fish they have caught, this information will be randomized based on the fish swimming, the larger the fish, the harder it should be to catch them. Once the user has had a chance to review this screen, they can \u2018try again\u2019 or \u2018frame my catch\u2019 which would add their catch to the leader board for that event.6.
