If things go well, I hope to hire the same freelancer for the additional phases:Phase 1: This app will be for iOS and and will essentially use the SDK for Scandit, or something just as powerful, to scan a large number of simple (\"1 dimension\") barcodes. The barcodes will be printed and physically arranged in a spread-out grid (columns and rows) on a wall. This app will need to be able to record the relative column and row of each barcode. As far as I can tell, Scandit doesn't currently record the relative locations of barcodes, but does a great job of reading many of them concurrently. Recording the relative locations may be the biggest challenge of this app.Once the bar codes are recorded by columns and rows, the app will do some simple processing to format the data (spreadsheet type of formatting) and upload it to a piece of software in the cloud that has an open API.I want the app's user interface to be simple and clean. It will have the barcode scan function and a send/upload function (which will give the user options of which project to upload to). It will need a setup screen to configure where to upload the data.I am not a software expert, but will do my best to understand and communicate clearly. I have a good relationship with the software company who's product this data will upload to. I will need help with getting this app into the App Store, as I have never developed an app before.That is it for phase 1. The next phases (not included in this bid) will involve additional options to format and upload the data to other pieces of software as well as some relatively-simple AR.  Future phases may also include recording and displaying data, based on user input and online resources.
