These can be animated or real life looking depending on the cost difference.2-the animals when seen on the phone or tablet should be small but when within range to be caught get larger3- they should spawn in designated various GPS locations and not exceed their boundaries, they should spawn at a rate of (about 2 minutes) this means  (about5-10) different animal varieties in each animal type will always be in the area.4-they should be visible in real time with the camera view and a catching net would be thrown on them to catch them.5-We need the ability to take a screen shot that has a share option at many of the screens6-the animals need to have the ability to level up level 1 is obtained 2 times faster than level 2 all the way to level 20. they would level up by feeding them every 12 to 18 hours. not enough food will get them sick and they would die after 48 hours. too much food they will not eat the food would go bad making them sick. they grow every time they are fed correctly. they grow when another spawn is picked up that is the same animal at a rate of 1 feeding. the level 1 to level 2 grow time is 1 feeding. level 2 to level 3 is from 2 more feedings or two more spawns and so on to level 20.7-the app would be priced at $1.99 and free with ads8- there needs to be options to hire a animal keeper to feed all the animals for 3 days, 7 days and 14 days. There needs to be an option to take extra vitamins to grow faster that last 1 day, 3 days and 7 days, there needs to be be an option to keep them in different size habitats, The free habitat would be 10x10x10 then decor can be obtained by logging in every day for 7 days in a row a new box every day.9-The exhibit that holds the animals will have a spit screen when you click on an animal that shows an enlarged animal and the other part of the screen will show various statistics about the animal.10, the app will allow for me to place animal spawn sites at any GPS location I desire and have a range they must always stay in or a range I can adjust.", "url": "/projects/graphic-design/app-design-edt-15392990/"}, {"title": "One Hour of Consulting for Mobile Apps and Games", "desc": "I am developing mobile apps, specifically ones built with the Unity game engine.
