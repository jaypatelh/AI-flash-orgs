We are looking for an iOS application that multiple people can use to help catalog the products by scanning the barcode to retrieve the UPC, and entering the associated price. Please note that we are using other applications to do this presently, but these other iOS tools come with many other features and stuff that make the process slow and costly.  The bottom line is that we want to streamline the process by allowing our team to scan, enter the price, and move on without having to worry about anything else.We need someone efficient and relatively creative who is capable of; while seeing only the starting data and final result, find the best path to accomplish the goal in a simple fashion.From the viewing side, there are just 4 'screens'/'phases' (apologies, I have no idea what to call this) that will be required for this application:1. Menu - when the app is launched, users will come to the 'welcome page', if you will.  Here, they can choose to Start Scanning(takes user to page 2), End Scanning or Export(note: Start Scanning, End Scanning will be used as sort of dividers to recognize what date to export when the time comes to do so, so that the application doesn't export all of the UPCs and Prices it's ever scanned.  If you can come up with a better, simpler way to accomplish this, please do.2. Scanning - literally camera view: Hold the camera up to the barcode, it scans the barcode and retains the UPC (barcode number).  (As soon as it registers the barcode and saves the UPC, it will take the user to page 3.3. Price Input - Just a keypad like you'd see on a phone with 12 buttons.  1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0, Return to Menu, and a \"last used price\"(e.g. scan an item, it's $2.5.  The next item you scan is also $2.5, so you can just hit this button) button would be great as well.4. Export - I don't know exactly what this will look like, and I don't care.  We just need a way to get all of the UPCs with their associated prices in/on a chart somewhere else.  That can mean making a list of all the UPCs and prices that someone can copy/paste into an email, or automatically entering the UPCs and prices into an internal spreadsheet while scanning, or any other awesome way you can think of doing it.

PLEASE DO *NOT* BID ANY AMOUNT EXCEPT FOR THE AMOUNT THAT THIS WILL COST TO MAKE.   THANK YOU!Android App only at the moment. Eventually I will add IOS app, but that will be separate project and has nothing to do with this bid.Ok, I had issues with posting a project and people bidding 1 amount and then saying another amount.  I will only pay the amount you bid for the app to be created and bug free. I know bugs happen and I want to make sure that bugs will be fixed and the price is worked into the bid.I will pay extra without issue for any  additional features, changes etc that I request after the requested app is built and complete. (example. after I receive app , I decide I want to change something a month down the road....Details:Android App . I would like it designed and built. I found a nice concept on Google play. It's kind of an auction type site. There's only a couple of apps that use this type auction type system. You buy credit (PayPal seems to be what people use) and you buy shares / tickets to try to win that item. Say there's a 50 Amazon gf. It would be listed, it would have say 65 tickets available. Once can you buy credit you can you can buy as many \"shares\" (basically raffle tickets) as you want. So say I bought 5 tickets for 5.00, the listing would then show 60 of 65 tickets available when I bought those tickets it would then show five random ticket numbers between say 10000 and 10065. When all the tickets Sal and the system is using a formula would generate a winning ticket number and whoever purchased that ticket would show up as the winner. (Example goraffle and the one I like best (Onederbuy (was named wonder buy). There existing ones are based out of China but I would like to do the first usa-1 it can be just like onederbuy as possible . I imagine that app can be extracted and you can see how it works. Ready to award within 24 hours. I asked that you only bid if you are positive you can make / duplicate something like onederbuy app. Some things you cannot see on app that will need to be done is a backend so that I can add/remove/change products and set ticket amount required before the winning number is generated.... Add, remove, change products on lucky wheel, create, modify coupon system  and set the ticket amount required,  some type of printable report so I can view winners. User management option and whatever else you feel is needed to make the app full function able like the onederbuy app. When someone wins, the system automatically  sends them push notification and a confirmation email.  Once I award , I can provide a few dollars so that you can try app and see how it functions. I pretty much want it like onderbuy but obviously different name and a little different layout so that its not exactly the same. Please email will any questions that may effect the amount you bid.  I will look at everyones profiles and award to whom I feel is the best person for the job. I may or may not contact you before awarding, so please bid the amount it will cost to create an app just like onderbuy (or go raffle but with a lucky wheel).I have attached the apk as I know some places cant download it. I also extracted the apk and provided those files also.Thank you for your understanding on bidding the amount to create the app. it will end up turning into extra money do to updates and changes.  I just don't want someone to bid 100 and then say oh it will be 1200 after I award it because I will have to leave neg feedback.
