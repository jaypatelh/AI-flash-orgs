Essentially, these track the financial transactions for each unit, as well as allowing for the creation of Violation letters, communications with owners, collecting dues, providing estoppel details for real estate transactions and other tasks of that nature.Both of our platforms are moving to a cloud-based, per unit billing system that will absolutely destroy our margins, so we are looking for someone to create us a proprietary software program that could allow us to combine the features we need the most into one software program that we'll host on our own Computer Server for employees to access.We would also like a corresponding mobile app that will allow managers to update property information easily on the go.We are a small company, and we really don't have a clear understanding of software lingo, so we're hoping someone can help break this down for us.
