The app will be mostly like the current application RollKoll you can find on the Google Play Store. This is what will be different. While you are assigned to an active job there are typically 3 tabs in the job (Job Details, Tasks, and Notes/Photos). I would like the \"Tasks\" tab moved to the end, and changes to \"Live Chat\". I would like the chat to be a chat room style setup where all the officers in the same job at the same time to be able to post. When they post the other phones will ding to notify them of a message so they can communicate while on the job. The Notes/Photos will stay if the same job number is issued again for a new date and time, but the chat will not be visible for the next shift. I would like a 4th tab added that allows the officers to take a picture, upload it, and send it to a email the coordinator puts in on the website. This will have a sent and received update on it so that the user will know that the email went through. Also on the main page where it displays jobs I wont set up differently. This app is designed for one organization to run and post all their jobs. I want to be able to go on the website as an administrator and input coordinators without admin rights. The coordinators will have their own logins where they can look up a app user by phone number or email and add them to their rooster. They can input their jobs and assign their own unique job number to the job and how many officers are needed. They will see who requests the job and they can decide who they want and add them to the job and it will send a notification that they got the job or was denied. The coordinator will also be able to log in and few everyones job details on what they worked so they can pay them using what every process they have independent from the app. I want the coordinator to be able to upload a tile and business name that shows on that main app page when the job comes up with the rest of the info on it under that similar to how RollKoll does it. Users can be assigned to multiple groups, but they can not request the groups themselves. They can only download the app and enter their information. The coordinator has to add them, similar to how the Group Me app works. Users will only see jobs in groups they have been added too. On the website I want the administrator to be able to assign how many users each coordinator can allow (20 or less, 50 or less, 100 or more). Also in the user profile I want them to not only have a profile picture that is associated with things they note or chat, but I would like an upload section where they take a front and back photo of their department ID. Basically this app would be mostly like RollKoll, but able to be personalized by the coordinators similar to Group Me, and a chat function like the When to Work app.", "url": "/projects/php/police-extra-job-app/"}, {"title": "Build a website and mobile apps", "desc": "Create a marketplace websiteb and mobile apps", "url": "/projects/php/build-website-mobile-apps-15303276/"}, {"title": "Hire a Mobile App Developer", "desc": "I need professional work for a Travel Website not exceeding 5 pages & a Web App which will run on the Website as well as on Mobile device.
