The downloaded material should be consultable and orderable from off-line too, sending the request as soon as the line becomes available again.The app should receive update push notifications that will open a webView at the web address mentioned in the notification.The interface is divided in 4 main sections: catalogues, collections , orders and product detailed.The developer should produce a login interface with e-mail and password, that should be saved in the device for use on every server call.Server calls are in https and occur passing it in post the type of action, the user and the password; the server responds in json format.The importans calls are:\u2022\tObtain the catalogues list: every catalogue will contain the list of jpeg photos to download,\u2022\tObtain the collections list: every collection will contain the list of jpeg photos to download.The app, after received the request, should control if those images are already downloaded on the device, otherwise  it should download those missing or those of which it has only an old version. In order to permit to the app to evaluate the version of the images too, the server will get back the name, the link from where to download, the size in byte and the date/time of the last modification.The app should present a message to the user notifing that there are data to download, if the user agrees, should start the \u2018download in progress\u2019 interface with it\u2019s wait symbol.For example if there are 10.000 images to download, the app should control every half hour by hash code request, if hash code changes , it\u2019s necessary to request the complete list and to verify if those images are present and up to date, otherwise it should propose to the user an update.The API to implement for the developer are:\u2022\tcatalogue list request: passing in input user  name and password, it will riceive in output the images list for every catalogue,\u2022\tcollections list request, it will receive in output the collections list with all the related images,\u2022\thash request to verify if there are updates,\u2022\tview orders page, only web view with a basic autentication with user name and password.\u2022\tCall for submit new orders\u2022\tGet detailed list of productAll the calls are in https.All texts and messages of the app should be stored in a dictionary file for a simple message management and we require translation into: Italian, English, Spanish .Server side will be on our own: after project approval, we\u2019ll pass you  an API use tecnical documentation.", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/app-catalog-with-photo-gallery/"}, {"title": "mobile app", "desc": "HiI am in desperate need of help to do my Final Year Project.

But in summary I am supposed to create a navigation app for any one mall in Singapore. I am thinking between a mall named Jurong Point and a mall named Far East Plaza. Jurong Point doesn't have a floor plan and Far East Plaza does. Jurong Point is actually 2 buildings that is connected whereas Far East Plaza is just one building. You can google these 2 malls and look at which mall seems doable and easier.So the app should let the user to reach the shop if the person is lost in the mall. The app should be able to display advertisements in text or image form when they come near to the shop probably. And the app should show the events happening in the mall and promotions for the respective shops etc. This is in summary. More details are in the document but the document has Jurong Point part only so you can search for Far East Plaza and compareI need this app as soon as possible given the deadline and I am a student who needs desperate help, the requirements are in the document too.

If there are no promotions, we can create our own promotion randomly for the respective shops in the form of text or image.
