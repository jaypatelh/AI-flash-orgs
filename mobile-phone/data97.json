No exceptions. You'll be tested.This work can be done from your computer and I only need you to be available for short periods of time throughout the day to send an email, or to chat with me about tasks. So you are able to do other work for other clients.You need WhatsApp: I generally leave voice messages via WhatsApp asking you to respond to an email, follow up on a contractor, etc.I need someone who can:- Handle all my emails and respond on my behalf. This will require you calling me and asking what kind of response is required, or I might get in first with a voice message telling you what I need. Over time you'll learn more and more and be able to respond yourself.- Organise tasks that my contractors need.- Follow things up... you'll need to keep yourself organised so if you're waiting on a response from someone and you don't get it... that you follow them up or contact me to say you've received no response.- Remind me of things I need to do that I said I would do for a client or contractor.I've spent 20 years working as a consultant and I need to reduce the amount of time I spend typing / staring at a computer screen, and definitely need to spend less time chasing up contractors who say, \"yeh I'll get that done by tomorrow morning\" but never do.IMPORTANT: I am looking for someone who is reasonable tech-savvy. Many of my emails are about website development. It's preferable if you understand these concepts on a technical level. You won't be doing this technical work... but you will be liaising with contractors who are doing this technical work.NOTE: If you have marketing experience (design, print, copyrighting, etc) then that helps as well - but not totally necessary.Example:I'll route certain emails from my project management software to you. You contact me on Skype / WhatsApp and tell me what questions have come in from a contractor. I'll explain what my reply should be and you type / send the replyExample:A certain email might be asking for some information that can easily be found on Google somewhere. You find it, and send it to that person.Example:I said I'd handle a particular problem but you see that nothing has been done yet. You contact me to ask why I haven't done it, or if you should update the other party to let them know I'm delayed.So it's all quite basic PA stuff, mostly typing / emails, but you MUST be able to ensure everything is followed-up on so things aren't forgotten.This job MAY lead to more \"office management\" work where you handle more and more of my correspondence, research, planning, co-ordinating my calendar, etc. It all depends on how good you are!To apply, please outline your experience with I.T, marketing, and of course PA / typing. Outline your availability and confirm that you can voice communicate using a smartphone app... AND please tell me the capital of Thailand in your application... and confirm that you speak FLUENT English", "url": "/projects/php/australian-based-personal-assistant-keep/"}]
