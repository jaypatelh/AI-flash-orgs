The dolphin should be animated so that it can have different speeds of swimming and jumping out of the water. The control of the dolphin should be done by the player. Here is a simple asset of a dolphin animation. The dolphin in this is to rough from the quality of the 3D Model, but the animations that come with it are a pretty good example:Sample of animated Dolphin:[url removed, login to view]!/content/77844As to the skin of the dolphin you find attached a picture of a photomontage for a dolphin made out of capacitors that I did before. The dolphin should have a look like that, only made with bigger capacitors on the skin.A good option would be to have a shark circle the water as well. The shark is controlled by the AI. Depending on who gets more capacitors in a given time, wins.Sample of shark attack:[url removed, login to view]!/content/83894The game should be playable on HTC Vive, with an option to play it on an ipad.However as said before, first step would be a Game Trailer, showing the action of the dolphin and the swarm.

Look at it from time code: 0:38[url removed, login to view]!/content/52103The Game Trailer would be approx. 90 sec.As to the capacitor, client will supply the 3D Model.
