Much like real estate, our salespeople with buyers and sellers. Currently, our sales reps are required to log all contact with their buyers and sellers.  With 300 sales reps and 770,000 customers, this is a lot of searching for your customer and logging contact activity.  Our aim with this app is to log that contact from and to their customers automatically for them, saving them time.We would like a mobile app developed and available for installation from the public app stores for our company contractors/employees.The primary goal of the app is to ping a URL on our server whenever an incoming or outgoing phone call or text message is received/sent.In the ping, we need the email address assigned by the user to the app (which will be a company email address) and the applicable details of the phone call/text message that we can get.The opening screen of the app would need to inform users that this app can only be used by employees and licensed contractors of our company.  There should be a button to authenticate using Google, which is the provider of our email addresses.Once authenticated through Google, the app would need to ping our server and we will respond with whether this is a valid email address or not.  If the email address is not in the format [user]@[url removed, login to view], there is no need to even ping our server, since it won't be valid.  Display an error to the user in these cases.If the email address is proper and our server responds with success, then the second screen in the app should display.The second screen should indicate that we need several permissions in order to track their phone call and text message activity.  On click of an Ok button, the user should be prompted with the requisite permissions necessary.Once the permissions are confirmed, the user needs to be presented with a test button that dials a specific phone number (will provide).  On dial of that number, our system will respond with a voice telling them they can hang up their phone and check their email.  The app will presumably send a ping to our server w/ their authenticated email address and the number dialed.  We will email the user that their phone call was indeed logged correctly.  The test button should be available from a menu for later testing.The app shouldn't solely be focused on these permissions.  While this is all we currently envision, the app should be built with a grander future in mind.  The opening screen is our logo, and a Google button to authenticate.  Once authenticated, they are taken to this permissions screen, but it should ultimately only be one page in an app that could have more functionality later.That's it!Nice to haves would be:- The text/attachments to the text message.- Another ping when the phone call ends, so we can track the length of the call.- Other details about the call, for example was it answered by the user or did it go unanswered.- The ability to turn on/off each of the permissions, using toggles?", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/mobile-app-for-android-ios-15594709/"}, {"title": "Website Design", "desc": "Creating a website design for a digital marketing company", "url": "/projects/website-design/website-design-15594856/"}, {"title": "Important Days \u2013 APP", "desc": "The Important Days is an App which can help the users to remind of the important days so that they will not miss them.The Important Days is free for the users and they do not create an account.

The users can put all the briefs in an order according to the level of importance. On the right top corner of the interface, there will be a link to create a new day matter. The first step is to enter name of the matter which will happen or has happened on the date. Then to choose the date in detailed.

There are also some options below for the users, like whether to put this matter on the top of the list in the interface and whether to send a notice and how often to send it. For the frequent of notice, they can choose from every day, every week or every month. Finally the users can save the day matter and it will be back to the interface and on the list.When the day matters have been set, it can help to remind the users of their important days.
