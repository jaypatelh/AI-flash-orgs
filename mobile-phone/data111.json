So if the user needs 10 categories created they should be able to specify the category name and word list for creating unique categories.Eg... New Joomla category is called \"Sample Instance\" and list contains location details such as London, India, Australia, America...etc... The tool should be able to automate the creation of required new categories as \"Sample Instance London\", Sample List Australia..etc by a user single button click.Article Creation: Automate new article creation from the main article by selecting new words from the predefined word list and making changes to the keywords, meta description and main content by the single click of a button.Menu Creation: Create new menu title from each article title instance per category. Automate the association between the new article and correct menu title created by the press of a button.The tool should be able to create new menu category or select existing categories for the new menu link per article category.All new article and menu link must be published and not requiring users to carry out this activity.In essence, we need a tool that can automate the manual process currently being carried out to increase productivity.Please let me know if this makes sense and when you are available for a session to discuss.", "url": "/projects/app-developer/bulk-content-replication-menu-linking/"}, {"title": "Marketplace/classified ads Website and mobile apps", "desc": "Classified Ads some main characteristics:-Social media friendly/social media log-in-SMS phone number verification-Products by area/location-Chat to buy/live chat (no money transfer through website)-Make an offer on item-Exchange (make an exchange offer of your item to other item available to exchange; with specs/filters options for exchange)-Detailed product listing (exs: brands, car specs, phone memory, property area and building/constructed area)-Property listing with maps location-Questions system-Sort and filter-ads, moneteizing and memberships/certified-members-payment gateway of my choice-able to support massive amounts of ads-It can be produced in english but final application should be in portuguese.
