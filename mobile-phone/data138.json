The current search function requires users to search by city- I want the app to be able to show current parking spaces that are available by scrolling with their finger on the map and having the app update the available spaces (if too many spaces in the given map area simply a notification that the search area needs to be redefined.2. The admin panel on the backend needs to be corrected so that after the user has paid and host has entered payment details that the administratyr can pay the host his booking fee via the two payment portals (currently apple pay with stripe or PayPal.3. Currently if a host lists a spot for $15 the user pays $15 and after processing fees and Gameday fees (10%) the host would end up receiving a payment of $12.
