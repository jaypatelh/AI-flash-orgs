I think it is pretty much self-explanatory.More specifically, I need the app to have the followings enables:1- It should support different languages. It can be built for English and I can modify it for other languages myself. So I need the complete source code, and also all the codes should be UTF8 compatible.2- Of course it should be able to easily communicate with the database which I will provide the credentials and structure to search through (based on MySql).3- It should use an storage on internal memory in order to save the people whom the user has already ranked. So the user cannot rank one person more than once in a day.The design is of course not final and needs lots of work, but the functionality is pretty much the same.
