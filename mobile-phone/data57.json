It is for a restaurant where the kitchen is on a different floor than the restaurant. There is an iPad in the kitchen that needs to have a simple list of servers, each one on there own button, that when touched will send a predetermined \"order up\" message to a specific servers iPad. It would ideally flash the button on the iPad until the server has touched the message on their iPad.The server iPad needs the incoming message to pop up on screen, and make a noise (perhaps every minute?). If they touch the pop up message it would disappear completely, without staying in message center.The kitchen buttons should be adjustable when held. When in this page, the name on the button needs to be adjustable, and the IP address for the iPad that will receive the message, and any other settings that need to be entered to allow this to work.Best case would be for this app to be accessed on the kitchen IPad by swiping in from one of the sides or top, but that is not a big deal if it is not possible.A master settings page could also be used instead of each button if that is easier.I don't know what apps usually cost, so please let me know if it could be done in this budget or if I am way out to lunch.Thanks for looking!!", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/design-simple-ios-messaging-app/"}, {"title": "assignment for software enggerring", "desc": "Where? Near RestaurantsThe \u201cDinning Closely\u201d is a GPS (Global Positioning System) based mobile and web application which helps people to find the closest restaurants based on the user\u2019s current position and other specification like price, restaurant type, dish and more. The main advantage of the system is the customers can check the availability within the restaurant and book tables for number they want. Further, they can order their dishes before they arrive and give approximate time of arrival. Not only that they can pay for the orders before they are physically present in the restaurant. The application should be free to download from either a mobile phone application store or similar services.Restaurant owners can provide their restaurant information using the web based system designed to enter their information. This information would include the name of the restaurant, type, opening hours, prices, address, and etc. This information will act as the bases for the search results displayed to the user. The booking system of the restraints are called by the special gateway system to update the restaurant availability.An administrator also uses the website to administer the system and keep the information accurate and updated. The administrator can, for instance, verify restaurant owners and manage user information. Further, administrator is responsible for adding GPS information of the registered restaurant to the database.Furthermore, the software needs both Internet and GPS connection to fetch and display results. All system information is maintained in a database, which is located on a web-server.The software also interacts with the GPS-Navigator software which is required to be an already installed application on the user\u2019s mobile phone. By using the GPS-Navigator, users can view desired restaurants on a map and be navigated to them. The application also has the capability of representing both summary and detailed information about the restaurants.1. You are working as a Business Analyst / Software Engineer for StarSoft Pvt.
