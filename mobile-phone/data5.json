We work with products that are print on demand and need to ensure that our product titles do not infringe on trademark.Due to the number or products we have, it will be necessary to find someone confident who can perform this task for us on a monthly or bi-monthly basis.This is a very simple task that really only requires your attention to detail and ability to copy and paste data into a list. Basically you would go through our list of products title by title and verify if the title is on USPTO. If it is, you will add the title of our product to your list. If it's not on the USPTO website then you can leave it alone.Once you have completed analyzing the data and creating your list of titles that have shown up on USPTO, your job is done.Some product titles may be long and we will need you to break up the title into smaller and more common phrases to search for individually. For example if my product title is \"John Went Across The Street For Pizza Last Week\". When you check USPTO, you need to do separate searches for \"John Went\" \"Across The Street\" \"For Pizza\" & \"Last Week\". Also, for common or popular nouns, we will need you to search those individually. Since the list will be longer with those words/nouns we will provide you with a tool to make it easier. Common words in the example above include \"Street\" & \"Pizza\".The number pf products we have is approx 1800. That number is going up and down daily but there are MANY duplicates. Out of 1800 listings there are probably only 600 different titles you will need to search.If you have experience using USPTO ([url removed, login to view]) this will greatly benefit you over any other proposal. If not, no problem, it's not hard to figure out. If everything works out with this job we will train you on a tool that will make this a lot easier. Although, knowing how the USPTO website works first is important.There is no rush on the job however if you can finish properly in 48 hours we will provide a $30 bonus. (Job Needs To Be Done Properly!)If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Otherwise happy bidding!*Please type #NOV17 somewhere in your message so we know you read and understand everything in this posting. If you have #NOV17 in your message we will assume you completely understand what we have asked for above. If you don't understand please ask.*No milestones over 50% will be accepted. What this means is we will not create a full milestone once accepted. Only half will be created max.PS - If you know how to search trademarks accurately using this website and can prove it. I will hire you over anyone else.

The first component will be a Reading App (for Android & IPhone) that supports a dialogue between teachers and students either in real-time or in batch mode using sound or video clips. We have been using WeChat for this so far, but it doesn't keep sound, video files long enough. And we want to be able to re-use them.In our app, the teacher will read one of the story books in the app library and broadcast it to the class. Each student will respond by sending their own reading of the story to the teacher. They may want to send this in a video that their parents take on the phone, or an audio file. The teacher will then respond to their reading with a set of corrections to pronunciation of words or phrases. These are usually sound clips. Responding sound clips with correct pronunciations for each word or phrase in the story can be stored and reused for any student as well as to groups of students. This reduces the teaching effort.This is the core of the project. Later we will have other components to add to it.
