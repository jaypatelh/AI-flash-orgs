The fields are:Group Name (id)Group Password (password the users need to enter the group)Max Members (2 to 8 people can play)Sound that will play (sounds will be included in the APK, internal)After the group is created, the creator goes to a loading screen that shows how many users out of the max are in the party. For example if 3 out of the max 5 set by the creator are ready to play the screen will show \u201c3/5\u201dUSER CLICKS ON \u201cJoin Group\u201d:The user clicks \u201cJoin Group\u201d and is shown a list of active groups with a search bar on the top of the screen. He can then search for the group created by his friend. Once he finds the group, he can click to fill the password and join the group.THE IDEA OF THE GAMEAll 4 people are now playing. A of 10 seconds starts counting down on ONE of the random users, when the counter reaches 0 there is a 1/7 chance that the sound selected by the creator will go off on that users device if not the counter will go onto the next user and so on until one of the users get unlucky and the sound goes off.AFTER THE SOUNDAfter one of the users loses, the users have the option to \u201cPlay again\u201d or \u201cLeave\u201dTHAT\u2019S IT!", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/simple-user-app-ionic/"}, {"title": "Some update and touches to IOS APP", "desc": "I need an iPhone/iPad app. I already have a design for it, I just need it to be built.", "url": "/projects/mobile-phone/some-update-touches-ios-app/"}, {"title": "universal cart - open to bidding", "desc": "i need a universal cart like...[url removed, login to view]", "url": "/projects/php/universal-cart-open-bidding/"}, {"title": "I would like to hire a Mobile App Developer flyer click", "desc": "Hello;I want to ask about apps such as the following appsClick flyer appOn android and ios operating systems[url removed, login to view]I want you to do the same apps for meapp that is transforming the shopping experience for people like you by creating a single platform with easy access to weekly offers for your family needs, from all the leading retailers.

The app is for coupon purchase and redemption that has four users.  1) the UNREGISTERED user can browse the coupons available for purchase and can register 2) the REGISTERED user can make an in-app purchase of one set of the coupon deck (52 coupons) and receive a credit that is shown next to or below each coupon.  When the registered user goes to redeem the coupon, he/she presents their phone to the business and the business owner presses a \"Redeem button\" on the coupon and then types in a four digit pin to reduce the coupon credit by one unit (I'm open to alternative redemption methods).  3) the BUSINESS OWNER can log into the app to change the text of his/her one coupon.  He/she can also view the performance statistics for each coupon to include date coupon (text changed) began/ended and number of redemptions for that coupon.  There should also be a profit-calculator feature where the business owner can go to the statistics and enter in a profit estimate per redemption for each coupon and see the sum total of profit.  I would also like them to be able to see the total number of redemptions and the number of unique users who contributed towards those redemptions.  4) the ADMIN user needs access to each business account and the ability to disable/enable the account.  The Admin should also be able to view registration, coupon purchase, and coupon redemption statistics by week and in total.  The Admin user will also need to be able to collect payment from the registered user through the app (I'm not sure how that works).User Interface/Experience Design:There are only 52 coupons in this app, and each coupon is shaped like a playing card with a card value, an image to represent the business, the general business card information (name/address/phone/website), and the deal text (which the business owner can edit).The coupon will be imported into the app as an image, though the app design should allow for a text display box to appear within the card to show the deal that the business is offering.Search Feature:When the unregistered/registered user opens the app, the should first see our logo/banner followed by a search bar.  The user can search by any word in a business name, or by card suit or card value (hearts, two of hearts, 2 of hearts, etc.).  The search results should show the card images in order by best search fit.Browse Feature: Below the search bar, the user should see a drop down menu that offers six sort features for the 52 cards.  The first, and the default, is \"Alphabetical.\" This sorts the cards in order by their card name.  The second is by \"Suit,\" this sorts the cards by descending card values (Ace-2) in the order of Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades.  The third is by \"Hearts.\"  The fourth is by \"Diamonds.\" The fifth is by \"Clubs,\" and the sixth is by \"Spades.\"I will need a recommendation from your team as to where and how I can give directions to the user for how to use the app and purchase a deck of cards (1 unit of each coupon).There will also be confirmation pages (coupon deck purchased, account creation, coupon redeemed), a terms of agreement page, and an error page (something went wrong with your purchase).See the attachment for what a playing card will look like and where the deal text box should be displayed for each card.
