NEW TASK SCREEN OPENS . Input boxes: task name , task objective. Then a button ADD FIRST STEP IN THE TASK to add task steps, with once a STEP is created, user can add NEXT STEP, and so on, as many steps as he wants , add a finish date and click SAVE.USER SCREEN has list of existing tasks.Each task will show 1) task name 2) task objective 3) finish date, 4) next step and DONE BUTTON 5) EDIT / DELETE buttonThe basic principle is that the app will display for each task, the NEXT STEP. Once a step is finished user can click the DONE button. Once DONE button is clicked he is now presented with the NEXT STEP from the entered steps. Once he is on the last step, he is presented with the FINISH TASK button.There will be a log button for each task that will take him to a text screen that shows when the task was created, which steps are finished and dates and times steps were finished , which steps remain etc etc.Users have to login /signup. Users get a 30 day free trial, and if they want to continue they have to sign up with a paypal subscription.Admin panel (on website) shows members,  type of membership, duration, dates payment was made etc. Admin can enter his paypal id here, change his admin password, change emails (welcome email, registration email , membership will expire soon email, premium membership email, membership has expired etc)EVERYTHING MUST BE 100% RESPONSIVE DESIGN, must look pleasing to the eye.ABSOLUTELY NO BIDS FROM INDIAPAKISTAN PLEASE.
