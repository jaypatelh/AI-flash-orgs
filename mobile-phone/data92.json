The customer gives the generated code to the cashier and the cash enters it and immediately the customers account is debited and the shop account is credited.The cellphone of the customer should be linked to his bank account/credit account to allow transactions.The shop and the bank should accept the InstaPay as a method of payment just like credit card and debit cards.The instapay  can be use for online shopping and conversional shops just like a credit card and can also be used for sending money, depositing money and withdrawing money from anywhere in the world.Bank account, cellphone number/sms/email, application and code generation should do the magic.Instapay should be intergrated in shops, banks, websites, on the same platforms with credit cards.The instapay app on the cellphone or online app should serve as a profile for any individual if you dont have your cellphone, you can log in instapay platform and  change an option on how to receive the once of code for transactions unless you have added beneficeries then no need for onxe off code.
