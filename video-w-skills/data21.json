A point cloud model should then be generated from the set of images, before a subsequent mesh (eg. TIN model) is overlayed.As one side of this building is lacking in image coverage due to the flight path, the challenge then would be to create a construct a  clean, good-looking model on all 4 sides of the building - aesthetic appearance is important in this project.Open to ideas but am hoping to get this project completed as soon as possible.Many thanks!Best regards,XuI will also require a video fly-through of the final product.If preferred, I can provide the resampled image set but would prefer the pixel resampling to be done by the awardee.", "title": "Image Resampling & 3D Model Generation from Aerial Imagery"}, {"url": "/projects/graphic-design/video-animacia-pre-prezentaciu-softwaru/", "skills": ["2D Animation", "Engineering Drawing", "Graphic Design", "Photoshop Design"], "desc": "zdravim , hladam pomerne lacn\u00e9ho freelancera \u010do sa zaujima o video animacie . o nedlho budem predava\u0165 software (automtick\u00fd obchodn\u00fd syst\u00e9m) a chcem ma\u0165 animaciu na predstavenie produktu a prezentaciu pre\u010do je produkt lep\u0161i ako \"konkuren\u010dn\u00e9\".napi\u0161em vam sc\u00e9nar , a vysvetlim podrobne o \u010do ide , a \u010do chcem aby tam bolo pou\u017eit\u00e9, a vy sa u\u017e zariadte podla toho  pi\u0161te na email [Removed by [url removed, login to view] Admin].   po\u017eadujem si pozrie\u0165 va\u0161e portfolio pr\u00e1c . jedna sa len o privorobenie , teda \u0161tudenti alebo lacn\u00fd freelanceri .", "title": "Video animacia , pre prezentaciu softwaru."}, {"url": "/projects/video-editing/make-video-15600406/", "skills": ["Video Editing", "Videography"], "desc": "i already gathered a pictures & videos to be edited but I realized that I have zero skills in this area plus I have one year old baby that needs my attentions.I already hired a professional video editor in freelancer as well but suddenly there's no updates as he supposed to submit the video by today.This video means a lot to me because I want my husband to realize how much he is [url removed, login to view] husband kinda depress on the inside so i want to make him feel alive and happy and through this video he knows that we love him.I have few days left as I want to play this video on his suprise birthday celebration this coming tuesday 14th November 2017.I REALLY NEED A HELP TO TURN ALL THOSE NOT NICE VIDEOS TO BE EDITED TO LOOK NICER.U CAN USED UR CREATIVITY TO PUT A SONG IN IT TO REARRANGED THE VIDEOS..to combined all the videos and pictures to be one beautiful and memorable video for him. i really need that video by SATURDAY.", "title": "Make a Video"}, {"url": "/projects/video-services/design-project-15600058/", "skills": ["3D Rendering", "Supplier Sourcing", "Video Services"], "desc": "I need a 3D model of something.
