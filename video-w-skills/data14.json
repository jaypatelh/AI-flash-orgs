Easy and quick :)- I\u2019m looking for one individual.- You must be capable of following instructions, and keeping track of tasks performed.- I will require a message at the end of a work-time letting me know what was worked on.- Why you want to work for me:- I\u2019m trained in a hands-off management style. I\u2019ll give you a list of things to do, and I\u2019ll let you go do them. I\u2019m not going to be stalking you ten times a day asking for updates and why things aren\u2019t being done. Everything you will need to know will be in the daily/weekly breakdown, and I will always be available for questions.- I\u2019m not going to ask you to video call or team view me or any of that.- I hate micromanaging, so I\u2019m not going to do that with you.- As long as you get done what I ask you to do, I don\u2019t care how little time it takes you, I\u2019m still paying you the $. PRODUCTIVITY!- I\u2019m culturally sensitive. I won\u2019t expect to hear from you on Republic Day, Independence Day, Gandhi\u2019s Birthday, Christmas, New Year\u2019s, Maha Shivaratri, Holi, Nag Panchami, Dussehra, Diwali, and whatever else I might be missing. Same goes for other cultures and religions and whatnot.- If I end up firing you, you will have plenty of advance notice. Doing shitty? I\u2019ll mention it. Still doing shitty? That\u2019s a NO-GO. Respect me and expect the same and return.- And here is why you REALLY want to work for me:- Bonuses. I plan to do this with my   assistants.-  Example: Expect a Christmas gift in the form of a cash bonus. Birthday too. I\u2019m a generous guy, and I like to make sure my \u201cemployees\u201d are happy.- Provide me with this info\u2019s on your application:- Age- Location (city, country)- Can you do voiceovers ?(YES-NO. Voiceover needs to be amateur and in fluent english)Rates? Depends on the type of video, most will be 5$ per video. Some 10-15$, cause they will need a bit more work than the 5$ ones.Personally I take 30m to make/edit the videos. I\u2019m not a pro at all! Productivity is key!Initially you may spend a bit more time per video, but when you practice it few times it will become automatic. Imagine that initially you spend 1hour per video, that\u2019s 5$ x hour. Do it in 30 minutes, that\u2019s $10/hThat\u2019s All,- You think you can handle joining my team?", "title": "<Long-Term> Amateur [Video Creation-Voiceover-Simple editing] -- 2"}, {"url": "/projects/video-services/video-product-review-15683727/", "skills": ["After Effects", "Video Editing", "Video Production", "Video Services", "Videography"], "desc": "I need someone to review my products and film (Must be Australian or indian)", "title": "Video product review"}, {"url": "/projects/video-services/video-content-15683700/", "skills": ["After Effects", "Video Editing", "Video Production", "Video Services", "Videography"], "desc": "Hi i need someone to create 'how to video' for my vlog, around 1 minitue each person", "title": "Video content"}, {"url": "/projects/video-services/want-six-minute-video-for/", "skills": ["3D Animation", "After Effects", "Animation", "Video Editing", "Video Services"], "desc": "animated explanation video on metaphor use this article for video [url removed, login to view] . explain the things mentioned in this article.", "title": "want a six minute video for youtube"}, {"url": "/projects/video-services/design-project-15683402/", "skills": ["3D Rendering", "Supplier Sourcing", "Video Services"], "desc": "I need a 3D model of something.", "title": "Design project"}, {"url": "/projects/graphic-design/need-very-artist-designer-for/", "skills": ["3D Animation", "3D Design", "3D Modelling", "3D Rendering", "Graphic Design"], "desc": "Hi there,i have a few sketches that i would like to convert into 3D images.
