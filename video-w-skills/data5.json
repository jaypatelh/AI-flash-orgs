It could be just an exterior environment, like an alley. Or it could be a product that happens to be shown in an exterior scene - like a bike, shoe or car. As part of this assignment you shall capture and gather a minimum of 50 reference images/videos of your item. Model your object based off of your references as accurate as possible. Your mesh type shall be of the type polygon. Create photo realistic materials by using procedural textures and maps where appropriate. Set up a lighting scenario to promote your item as a selling packshot or product visualization or lifestyle image. Present your current progress each and every day by using your dailies folder inside of your project. Keep in mind that we are looking for a realistic end result.1.3 PreparationThink of what kind of final image you would like to produce. What kind of feeling do you want your image to produce? Camera angles, moods and format plays a big part of this. Decide upon your item and then do the proper research, how is it used, built, coated, painted and such? Get to know everything about what you are trying to re-create. See the item/scene in person, go somewhere or to someone who might have it and ask to check it out. Bring your finest camera and take photos of everything.Folder structure:For this assignment you shall be using the default built in project system of Maya and it's default project structure. With the exception of adding a dailies and a references folder. Create a project in Maya, and create 2 custom folders named \"dailies\" and \"references\". When you are booting up a new session of Maya you will have to use the function 'set project' to sync your paths. This is very important to keep relative file paths. It is quite common for projects to get big so please clean out any and all unused files and versions. Aim to submit a project with the maximum size of 200mb. Make a .zip of your entire project and name it [url removed, login to view]\". Where N is the number of your group. Make sure to remove \"excessive\" files, images, references and what not. We only want to save what is connected to your final maya [url removed, login to view] file:We don't need all different file versions for submission, leave only one file in the scenes folder named [url removed, login to view]'. Where N is your group number. Keep in mind that the output should be of ascii file format(.ma) and not binary(.mb). It is expected of you to have a nice and organized scene with everything named properly.Dailies:All of your dailies must be supplied in your projects dailies-folder. At the end of each day you simply take a few snapshots, playblasts and such and place it in a folder with todays date. NOTE that the dailies need to show in the filename WHO made them.exteriordailies2016-09-182016-09-192016-09-202016-09-21 and so on...You need at least one still image each and every day.Name your daily files to what they represent. Example: \"[url removed, login to view]\" or \"[url removed, login to view]\". Also make sure to put names or initials so it's easy to distinguish who's working on what.We expect it to be one folder for each working day.References:As you need a minimum of 50 references you will have to supply these aswell, these should all be placed inside of your 'references' folder. For extra credit, present them as collages as for example an A4-page with several images, it could have one page for shapereferences, one for material references etc.OutputFormat: EXRResolution: 1920x1080.Name: [url removed, login to view] (where N is your group-number)1.5 EquipmentSchools computers with Maya, Photoshop, Nuke and VRay", "title": "exterior scene"}, {"url": "/projects/php/create-simple-video-chat-website/", "skills": ["HTML", "Javascript", "PHP", "Video Services", "Website Design"], "desc": "i need someone to create a video chat website where people can chat or video call .features needed :sign in / sign upChat / Video callprofile pictureusers need to pay for video call (i mean add payment option before a user can chat ) free and premium option .you can use many free open source/code from online available and edit themthank you", "title": "Create simple video/chat website"}, {"url": "/projects/video-services/design-project-15789097/", "skills": ["3D Rendering", "Supplier Sourcing", "Video Services"], "desc": "I need a 3D model of something.

Imagine the boy is sitting on a chair but suddenly starts running, turning round and round, No compromise on this point will be entertained.Question 1) What is the purpose of this head?Answer - This is going to be used for a youtube web series where this 10 year old boy is the actual actor and he wants a supporting actor who is going to be his own 3D character but only with the head in animation rest body will be his.Question 2) Why are we not going with a complete body animated copy of this boy?Answer - Its because there are two characters as I said above the first one is the actual boy and the other is the 3D head of the same boy with his body body. The actual speaking is going to be done by the 3D head character and the actual boy is never going to speak anything. We are going to launch this web series in multiple languages and therefore to enact in all those multiple language for anybody is impossible therefore we have chose to use the 3D head to do that so that a 3D animator can easily lip sync the same series in multiple languages by tweaking the 3D head lips.

The stage should be no larger than 400x300. I am not good at using the program but have the idea for the video. Would like it to begin with the 6 olympic rings each an interactive button that will begin the video. The olympic rings will then bounce on a track to race each other while the coloured ring chosen by the player will cross the finish line first. 1st, 2nd and 3rd will then go on a podium with awards around them and the remaining olympic rings in front of them looking on. Then I'd like to be able to click again and the 6  olympic rings form their interlocked shape like the iconic olympic symbol. If some of these actions are unable to be done I'm willing to work around it (such as the coloured olympic ring chosen by the player being the ring that wins)  as I'm unsure to the extent of animate's capability.
