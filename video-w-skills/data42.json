Because this is the first year of the show, I'm not sure what to expect and am hesitant to invest in a full crew.

So what I would like is for it to be more personal and capturing real moments. - aka we don\u2019t want the videographer filming us taking posed pictures. We want to have him/her capturing actual  moments from the ceremony, cocktail hour and reception. We want to make sure parts of our ceremony and the vows are captured with us speaking in the video, not just us mouthing them with music played over that which i have seen a lot of. During the time we are taking those posed pics, we would love it if our videographer could be meeting our guests and capture their well wishes to us.  We don\u2019t want to be the only people in our wedding video, it should show everyone who came and capture the great time they had at the reception. Also, we would like all of the speeches/toasts captured with audio (not played over with music).  We would like to look back at what they said one day and see the great time we had. please let me know if you can do this for us.
