Heres a small description about Howl. Centuries ago wolves lived together in peace. Prey was plentiful, predators never appeared, everyone got along well, and everything seemed just about perfect. Then, one day, a war broke out. The war went on for what seemed to be years. Sorrow, hate, anger, so many emotions were freed. Finally, when the war came to an end, the wolves of the forest split into six different packs based off their own mythical capabilities. The Pack of Thundering Paws, The Pack of Clamping Jaws, The Pack of Shimmering Moon, The Pack of Blazing Fire, and lastly, The Pack of Roaring Rivers. Territories were made and wolves were torn. Prey started becoming harder to find, and predators were everywhere. Things only continued to get worse, the fights. The fights were constant, wolves always fought, always injured or even died. Everything was completely switched around. It was the start of an agonized way of life. Even now the packs still remain enemies. Whirling around, scared someone's behind you, ready to snap your neck, wasn't a normal way to live. The Gods of the Skies have been sending out wolves from each pack to climb to the dangerous Fang Mountain. Legends say that the mountain holds great power, power that belongs to only wolves who truly deserve it. Wolves who will use it to end this misery and pain. But, every time someone attempted to climb the mountain, they were never seen of again. This system has been going on ever since wolves were split into packs. Not even one wolf has ever came back alive. Now that your a little informed, ill be needing an animator for this project. This will be a continuing series, meaning this will continue going on in episodes. I will be paying the animator and I expect 2d animation for this project. This animation will be hosted on youtube, the animator will be credited for all art and animation. The type of animals that will need to be animated will be wolves, dogs, elk, beavers, deer, fish, birds, ect. The type of environment, a forest filled with trees, leaves, lakes, stones, dens, underground dens, ect. I am an artist myself, so ill be glad to sketch out what some of the dens look like. (Most of them are rocky and clay looking) If you would like to animate in this project, please contact my email at poppyandme9@[url removed, login to view] or at my discord, RainbowNerds#8770 If your needing any more information on this project, then ill be glad to answer any questions you have.", "title": "Howl (Animation Project)"}, {"url": "/projects/video-services/time-travel-clock-work-animation/", "skills": ["3D Animation", "Animation", "Video Editing", "Video Production", "Video Services"], "desc": "I just need a clockwork gear animation that animates from very slow to fast.Please see the video for reference[url removed, login to view]", "title": "Time travel clock work animation"}, {"url": "/projects/rendering/walkthrough-storey-tower/", "skills": ["3D Animation", "3D Modelling", "3D Rendering"], "desc": "Need a 4 minute 3D walkthrough (exterior and interior) of a 24 storey tower.
