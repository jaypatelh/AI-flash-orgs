It could be just an exterior environment, like an alley. Or it could be a product that happens to be shown in an exterior scene - like a bike, shoe or car. As part of this assignment you shall capture and gather a minimum of 50 reference images/videos of your item. Model your object based off of your references as accurate as possible. Your mesh type shall be of the type polygon. Create photo realistic materials by using procedural textures and maps where appropriate. Set up a lighting scenario to promote your item as a selling packshot or product visualization or lifestyle image. Present your current progress each and every day by using your dailies folder inside of your project. Keep in mind that we are looking for a realistic end result.1.3 PreparationThink of what kind of final image you would like to produce. What kind of feeling do you want your image to produce? Camera angles, moods and format plays a big part of this. Decide upon your item and then do the proper research, how is it used, built, coated, painted and such? Get to know everything about what you are trying to re-create. See the item/scene in person, go somewhere or to someone who might have it and ask to check it out. Bring your finest camera and take photos of everything.Folder structure:For this assignment you shall be using the default built in project system of Maya and it's default project structure. With the exception of adding a dailies and a references folder. Create a project in Maya, and create 2 custom folders named \"dailies\" and \"references\". When you are booting up a new session of Maya you will have to use the function 'set project' to sync your paths. This is very important to keep relative file paths. It is quite common for projects to get big so please clean out any and all unused files and versions. Aim to submit a project with the maximum size of 200mb. Make a .zip of your entire project and name it [url removed, login to view]\". Where N is the number of your group. Make sure to remove \"excessive\" files, images, references and what not. We only want to save what is connected to your final maya [url removed, login to view] file:We don't need all different file versions for submission, leave only one file in the scenes folder named [url removed, login to view]'. Where N is your group number. Keep in mind that the output should be of ascii file format(.ma) and not binary(.mb). It is expected of you to have a nice and organized scene with everything named properly.Dailies:All of your dailies must be supplied in your projects dailies-folder. At the end of each day you simply take a few snapshots, playblasts and such and place it in a folder with todays date. NOTE that the dailies need to show in the filename WHO made them.exteriordailies2016-09-182016-09-192016-09-202016-09-21 and so on...You need at least one still image each and every day.Name your daily files to what they represent. Example: \"[url removed, login to view]\" or \"[url removed, login to view]\". Also make sure to put names or initials so it's easy to distinguish who's working on what.We expect it to be one folder for each working day.References:As you need a minimum of 50 references you will have to supply these aswell, these should all be placed inside of your 'references' folder. For extra credit, present them as collages as for example an A4-page with several images, it could have one page for shapereferences, one for material references etc.OutputFormat: EXRResolution: 1920x1080.Name: [url removed, login to view] (where N is your group-number)1.5 EquipmentSchools computers with Maya, Photoshop, Nuke and VRay", "title": "exterior scene"}]
