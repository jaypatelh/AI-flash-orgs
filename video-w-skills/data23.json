The hair will need to be simulated, stylised, textured and interacting with the hands. The animations will come from motion capture imported from Daz.- Lastly, I need to model from scratch an object/surface for the character to interact with.More generally the general skin textures could also be improved, but this is not a priority at this stage.If you feel like you can only take on part of this that will also work.Look forward to hearing from you.", "title": "CGI Character Animation, Modelling, Texturing"}]
