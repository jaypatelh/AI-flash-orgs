While you may be able to get a higher \u201ctop line\u201d sales price listing with a local Jersey City, Hudson County, New Jersey agent, that doesn\u2019t always boil down to more money in your pocket or less headache. Dive into the details below to compare your options.Work The Numbers And See Which Way Helps You Get There\u2026When you really work the numbers you start to see the real benefits that each way of selling your house offers.Yes, here at Allan Buys Homes we won\u2019t be able to offer you full retail value for your house\u2026 but we also offer other benefits that going the traditional house sale route can\u2019t offer.Like\u2026From offer to close and cash in your hand in as little as 7 daysYou can get rid of the headache of that property fast and avoid paying any more utility payments, tax payments, insurance payments, mortgage payments, you get the drill. If you list your house and wait 90+ days to close\u2026 you have to figure in all of the costs of holding that property during the time you have that property listed and are waiting for the property to close.Don\u2019t worry about paying those pesky closing fees (we\u2019ve got you covered)Because we are a full-service professional home buyer here in , we make it easy for you. We pay for all of the closing costs. What we offer you is what you get (of course minus any mortgage payoff or other encumbrances on the property). Pretty refreshing eh?So when you add up the time you could save by working with Allan Buys Homes , the no-hassle experience, and the money you\u2019ll save on commissions, fees, and holding costs while you wait to sell the traditional route\u2026 for many area home owners selling to a professional house buyer is the best viable option.", "title": "Animation for Real Estate"}, {"url": "/projects/video-services/design-project-15613129/", "skills": ["3D Rendering", "Supplier Sourcing", "Video Services"], "desc": "I need a 3D model of something.", "title": "Design project"}, {"url": "/projects/video-editing/make-video-15613118/", "skills": ["Video Editing", "Videography"], "desc": "Living an Experience.. transmute the energy to audience.", "title": "Make a Video"}, {"url": "/projects/video-services/animacion-rotulos-after-effects-segundos/", "skills": ["3D Animation", "After Effects", "Animation", "Motion Graphics", "Video Services"], "desc": "Make animation for text and logo, and page 4 of the PDF file,  arround 5 seconds by animation", "title": "Animacion de rotulos en after effects - de 5 segundos"}, {"url": "/projects/video-editing/make-video-15612966/", "skills": ["Video Editing", "Videography"], "desc": "we \"Quirksta Club\" start up Event Management Company in Coimbatore, We are looking for a  Corporate Video for our Company.", "title": "Make a Video"}, {"url": "/projects/rendering/courtyard-render/", "skills": ["3D Animation", "3D Modelling", "3D Rendering", "3ds Max", "AutoCAD"], "desc": "I need two renders for a courtyard and a pergola that will be constructed in the courtyard.
