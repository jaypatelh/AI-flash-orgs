This is a new website at http://www.H10.ca. Current focus is virtual career fairs.We currently host live \"face to face\" events and intend to move our live events to our new online platform. Currently the site has basic chat functionality as the primary communication method. There is public chat functions and private chat functions. These chats happen between job seekers and employers, users and admin, as well as resume advisers and job seekers.Now that phase one is completed we are moving on to phase 2 of development.Please quote based on the following project scope:The current site only has text chat functionality. You will need to add a Video chat function that operates the same way as typing chat. When inside the typing chat area the user can request a video chat as an employer if video chat is available for both parties or as a job seeker if video is available for both parties. The expectation is that you would tie a pre-existing API into this function. Please comment in your bid on API integration knowledge especially if it is video chat related.The website has a saved resume section currently. However, we need to make these uploaded resumes keyword searchable, sortable by name, date and rating. The rating system is not currently implemented and will need to be. It will be a star rating system from 1-5 for each candidate, plus a notes (short) field for each resume/candidate.Jobs spotlight: Under the already available careers page section the employer should be able to post jobs that they are focused on hiring for at an event. This would be a standard job posting format that allows a job seeker to have a quick view of jobs that the employer is focusing on. The job seeker should also be able to list themselves as someone interested in that job, similar to applying for the job. Basically click an \u201cI\u2019m interested\u201d button that the employer now can have that job seekers resume now attached to that job for future reference. This will need to be saved and recording in the saved resume section.Need a function to remove/black Job Seekers from chat if they are creating issues (admin and employers require this ability)Currently there is only public events available. We need a company to be able to create a private event that is invite only. The employer can define the start and end time and also a password to enter the event. The event will be on the calendar but only accessible with the password that the employer has defined.Private and public events:Currently events are always open and public. Admin needs to define an event that is public and when it will become public. There will be a start time and end time. Once set the event will become active at the start time and end at the end time. Outside of those hours the event would not be available to be attended by job seekers. Job seekers that are in an open event will be permitted to remian in the event after it closes but new users logging in will not have access to the event. There will also be a location component but I don\u2019t think that will really matter from a development perspective.Multiple public events running at the same time.
