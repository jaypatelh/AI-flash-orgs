I'm looking for a videgrapher ideally for around 5 hours to come around the city with me, no editing required. The most important factor is that you have both a passion and skill for conveying emotion through videos, reasoning below!** Note - this is for 5 hours of shooting around NYC, no editing requited and not a full project as other shots will later be completed in London **A little about the company:The Lion\u2019s Club (TLC) is on a mission to create the world\u2019s first \u201cgo to\u201d community of inspiring individuals and to share their stories with organisations\u2019 employees to create an inspirational, motivated and resilient work place. TLC acts as an intermediary between organisations and the inspiring individuals (the \u201cLions\u201d), who have all faced times of challenge in their lives and are passionate about sharing their experiences and how they have overcome them with others.My inspiration behind TLC comes from losing my own father in May 2015 when I was 23. My father was murdered whilst on a business trip and I have since been on my own journey and have now decided to step up, share my story and empower others to do so too, in order to inspire those currently in the midst of their own challenge.The company will be launched in the UK in January 2018. The video will be mostly filmed in the UK and edited in London but I need assistance in creating some shots over in NY. The video will be broken down into half about me and my life and then moving on to my motivation for launching TLC before finally talking about TLC. The video will be showing a range of emotions, in the order of the audience being engaged, shocked, saddened, supportive and finally wanting to be involved.Please reach out directly with your quote and a few ideas of shots in NY that would help me convey those emotions :-)Look forward to working with you next week!Gian", "title": "5 hours of a Videographer needed for NY shots"}, {"url": "/projects/video-services/create-explanatory-video-15734319/", "skills": ["Video Services"], "desc": "A leading digital currencies  exchange company in Asia is looking for a power pack team for our upcoming project \"The Killer Converter\"The following skills are needed1.
