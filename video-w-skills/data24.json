We would like to pay per image, knowing that some will be harder than others, but over time there would be a good average cost per scene, which we could discuss. We can start with a quote per project until we are all happy.Attached are some samples showing the quality we are looking for. Please only submit your proposal if you have regularly done work like this in short time frames. You would receive a large file - typically 5000 pixels wide, so you would need good, fast internet capability. You would return layered photoshop files to our Dropbox folders.This is a great opportunity for regular photoshop work. Please quote a price per view based on the quality of the attached files. Also, only apply if you can match this quality.Thank you.", "title": "Photoshop for architectural visualisation"}]
